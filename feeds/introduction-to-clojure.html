                    My daughter's blocks taught her to match shapes with a lot of fast feedback. Fast feedback is a powerful tool to learn any skill. I analyze how the blocks helped my daughter learn and compare it to learning Clojure.

                    Research shows that developing mastery of a large skill is best done by mastering smaller skills that you can achieve 90% accuracy very quickly. LispCast Introduction to Clojure has broken the skills you need down for you.
