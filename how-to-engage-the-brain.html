<p>Summary: <em>Our brains evolved to keep us alive long enough to reproduce in an environment of mostly immediate dangers (tigers) or slightly longer term reproductive opportunities (increasing social status). The brain does not respond well to learning information that does not help one of these.</em></p>
<p>Our brains have amazing potential. We can memorize lots of facts. We can produce beautiful edifices of thought. And we can learn new perspectives.</p>
<p>There's a lot of reason to learn new things. I mean, I would love to be able to learn new spoken languages,</p>
<p>What's the best way to learn a spoken language? Why? What does that tell you about how your brain works? What is the most intense learning experience you've ever had? What made it different from other times? Can you think of a time when learning came very naturally? What were the circumstances? Why was it so easy to learn?</p>
<p>What's the best way to learn a spoken language? Well, <em>I</em> would argue that immersion has a lot to do with it. There's a lot to be said about immersion. First, you're getting a lot of exposure. There's a lot of repetition of the same words and phrases, and there's lots of phrases in general. Exposure really helps. But more importantly, there is social pressure. It turns out the social pressure is vastly more important.</p>
<p>When we're in a foreign country, and people don't speak our language, we are in danger. We're in danger of not finding food. We're in danger of missing something important. And our brains know this. It is imperative that we communicate with the people around us. They can help us. So it's not the <em>hunger</em> that is driving us (though that might if you get really hungry), but a deeper, more abstract need to connect with the people around us.</p>
<p>We see people. Some are attractive. Some are friendly. Some have lots of food. Some have status. These aspects are relatively easy to see and understand, without language. And spending time around them, you might be intrigued to know what they are saying. Your brain is engaged, and is ready for information that might help you be social with them.</p>
<p>Our brains are smart in a way: we can recognize people's faces very easily. But they're dumb in another way: the wiring between the facial recognition part and the motivation to please and seek friendship, and other motivating factors, it doesn't know that the face is just a picture. <strong>Seeing a face in a picture activates the same pathways as seeing a real, live face on a real person.</strong></p>
<p>This is why ads work. There are often people in magazine ads and television ads. They're attractive and they're high status. The ads work, in general, to get people to buy. Why? The brain thinks they can be friends or lovers with those people.</p>
<p>We can do the same with our teaching materials. Faces</p>
<p>We also respond to pictures of food in a similar way. Hence ads for food with closeups of meat, cheese, and vegetables.</p>
<p>Putting pictures of food, people, babies, or danger activate the limbic system. Our brains get ready to learn something.</p>
<p>This &quot;cheap trick&quot; is what the ad industry spends billions of dollars on every year. Instead of</p>
