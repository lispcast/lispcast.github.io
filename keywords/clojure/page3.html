            Warty Lists in Clojure

        <div class="timestamp">
          May 27, 2014
        </div>

        
<p>Summary: <em>Lists are kind of warty in Clojure. Care should be taken, especially by those coming from other Lisps.</em></p>
<p>One of the things that still trips me up in Clojure is the actual types of lists. I used to program in Common Lisp, where things are a bit easier to understand: something is either a list or an atom. Lists are built out of conses and end with <code>nil</code>. Everything else is an atom.</p>
<p>Coming from Common Lisp, one might expect this to work:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (listp (cons 1 nil))</code></pre>
<p>In CL, it will be true. In Clojure, it is also true. (Try it out yourself!) Launch a REPL. Go to <a href="http://tryclj.com/">Try Clojure</a>.</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (list? (cons 1 nil))</code></pre>
<p>What about this:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (list? (cons 1 (cons 1 nil)))</code></pre>
<p>We're consing onto a list, should be a list, no?</p>
<p>In Common Lisp, yes. In Clojure?</p>
<p>NO!</p>
<p>That's not a list. Go ahead, try it at your Clojure REPL.</p>
<p>What gives? How is that possible? Are we living in a Kafkaesque ECMAScript World?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/kafkaesque.png" />
</div>
<p>Well . . . probably.</p>
<p>What's going on? Put on your Indiana Jones fedora. We're going on an adventure deep into the heart of the Clojure JVM implementation.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders3.jpg" />
</div>
<p>First, how is <code>list?</code> defined?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/richhickey/clojure/blob/a1eff35124b923ef8539a35e7a292813ba54a0e0/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L4961">In clojure.core</a>:</p>
<pre><code>(defn list?
  &quot;Returns true if x implements IPersistentList&quot;
  {:added &quot;1.0&quot;}
  [x] (instance? clojure.lang.IPersistentList x))</code></pre>
<p>Great, <code>list?</code> is just an instance check. <strong>What classes implement <code>clojure.lang.IPersistentList</code>?</strong> According to the javadoc on the Clojure sources, there are two: <code>PersistentQueue</code> and <code>PersistentList</code>. There's also a static inner class in <code>PersistentList</code> called <code>EmptyList</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see those at the REPL:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (type ())
  clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList
=&gt; (list? ())
  true

=&gt; (type (list 1 2 3))
  clojure.lang.PersistentList
=&gt; (list? (list 1 2 3))
  true

=&gt; (type clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY)
  clojure.lang.PersistentQueue
=&gt; (list? clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY)
  true</code></pre>
<p>These all return true when given to <code>list?</code>. What about <code>(cons 1 nil)</code>?</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (type (cons 1 nil))
  clojure.lang.PersistentList
=&gt; (list? (cons 1 nil))
  true</code></pre>
<p>Great. <strong>Consing onto nil gives you a list</strong>. Let's cons onto a list:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (type (cons 0 (list 1 2 3)))
  clojure.lang.Cons
=&gt; (list? (cons 0 (list 1 2 3)))
  false</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders4.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Oh, no! Why does consing onto <code>nil</code> create a list, but <strong>consing onto a list create a cons</strong>? Poisonous dart averted! Back to the source code!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/richhickey/clojure/blob/a1eff35124b923ef8539a35e7a292813ba54a0e0/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L22">In clojure.core</a>:</p>
<pre><code>(def
 ^{:arglists &#39;([x seq])
    :doc &quot;Returns a new seq where x is the first element and seq is
    the rest.&quot;
   :added &quot;1.0&quot;}

 cons (fn* cons [x seq] (. clojure.lang.RT (cons x seq))))</code></pre>
<p>So it calls <code>clojure.lang.RT/cons</code>. We can <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/1.5.x/src/jvm/clojure/lang/RT.java#L565">look that up</a>:</p>
<pre><code>static public ISeq cons(Object x, Object coll){
    //ISeq y = seq(coll);
    if(coll == null)
        return new PersistentList(x);
    else if(coll instanceof ISeq)
        return new Cons(x, (ISeq) coll);
    else
        return new Cons(x, seq(coll));
}</code></pre>
<p>Wow! The code is clear: if the second argument is <code>null</code> (<code>nil</code>), <strong>it makes a <code>PersistentList</code></strong>. Otherwise, it constructs a <code>clojure.lang.Cons</code>, which is not a list! We're at the root of our wart, but there's nothing we can really do about it except keep exploring.</p>
<p>If I have a list (according to <code>list?</code>) and I want to add an element to the front to make a new list, how do I do that?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders%205.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Well, the answer is a little disappointing:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (def ls (list 1 2 3))
=&gt; (def ls2 (conj ls 0))
=&gt; (list? ls2)
  true</code></pre>
<p><code>conj</code> will maintain the type, <code>cons</code> will not. What happens if I <code>conj</code> onto a <code>Cons</code>?</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (def c (cons 1 (cons 2 nil)))
=&gt; (conj c 0)
  (0 1 2)
=&gt; (type (conj c 0))
  clojure.lang.Cons</code></pre>
<p>So, there you have it. It's a bit of a wart having all of these slightly different types and predicates like <code>list?</code> that slice them up in odd ways. Sometimes it's like running away from a giant paper-mache ball.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders6.jpg" />
</div>
<p>In Clojure's defense, I will say that <strong>I rarely use <code>list?</code></strong>, if at all. It's <strong>not a very useful function</strong> in <code>clojure.core</code>. I'm usually working at a much higher level than that, thinking in terms of sequences (an abstraction), not their concrete implementations. And in the end, you never get out of danger.</p>

<p>Null pointers are <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">considered by their inventor</a> to be a huge mistake. Clojure inherits its null pointer, called <code>nil</code> in Clojure, from the JVM. In contrast to Java<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, Clojure seems to embrace the null pointer. In this post, I'd like to explore how Clojure uses the null pointer in what is often called <em>nil-punning</em>.</p>
<p>Nil-punning has its roots in the very first Lisps, where <code>nil</code> was both false (the boolean value) and the end of a list (the empty list). It was also often used to represent &quot;no answer&quot;, as in what is the first element of an empty list. It is called <em>punning</em> because you can use it to mean different things in different contexts.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>In Clojure, <code>nil</code>, as a value, is nearly void of meaning. And it is all pervasive, because it can be returned from any Clojure function or Java method.</em></p>
<p>Let's go through that last part bit by bit.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>It <em>is</em> a value.</strong> Java made the mistake of making <code>null</code> a lack of object even though it was pointed to by an object pointer. You can't call methods on it. It is not an object. It has a weird <em><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/typesValues.html#4.1">nameless type</a></em>. Clojure did not make this mistake. It is a first-class value and type<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>, meaning <em>it can be compared to other values</em>, <em>it can implement protocols</em>, and be used as <em>the key or value of a map</em>, etc. Using <code>nil</code> where it doesn't make sense in Clojure code is <em>usually</em> a type error, not a NullPointerException, just as using a number as a function is a type error.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>It is nearly void of meaning.</strong> It means &quot;no answer&quot;, but not much more. Because of this, <em>it can take whatever form fits the context</em>. With proper wisdom in choosing what form it takes, <code>nil</code> can become an asset instead of a liability. Clojure takes nil-punning to an extreme.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>nil</code> can be many things. To name but a few, <code>nil</code> plays <code>false</code> as a boolean. It plays the empty <code>seq</code> as a <code>seq</code><sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>. It plays the empty map as a map. Because <code>nil</code> has a role to play in most of the major abstractions of core Clojure, it rarely leads you into an <em>error</em> situation. An unexpected nil can surprise a good programmer, just as much as an unexpected <code>Nothing</code> from a Haskell function can bewilder even the most experienced Haskeller. <sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> Finding out where a <code>nil</code> came from is the hardest problem that <code>nil</code>s present.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>It is all-pervasive.</strong> <code>nil</code>s are normal parts of Clojure programs. They are not anomalous as in Java, where you often have to check it everywhere. This means it is always on the experienced programmer's mind. <code>nil</code>s flow like water through s-expressions.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>first</code> has nothing to return if the seq is empty, and so it returns <code>nil</code>. Because <code>nil</code> is a seq, <code>first</code> works on <code>nil</code>, and returns <code>nil</code>. <sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>. <code>rest</code> works on <code>nil</code> as well, because <code>nil</code> is a seq.</p>
<p>These examples show the best of nil-punning. <strong>When nil-punning works right, <code>nil</code>s are expected and they give the expected results.</strong></p>
<p><code>nil</code> is everywhere, but it can be used mostly everywhere as well--without error and often with exactly the desired result. There are many abstractions that <code>nil</code> does not participate in (for instance IFn, which is Clojure's interface for things that can be called like functions). In these places, <code>nil</code> can present a problem--a problem of type, the same as if you tried to call a number as a function.</p>
<p>The best thing to do, in my experience, is simply to wrap the expression in a <code>(when )</code> to catch the <code>nil</code> cases, if appropriate, while also preserving it. Otherwise, perhaps letting the Exception bubble up is the best answer. If you got a <code>nil</code> where you couldn't use one, the stack trace is probably your best clue to where it came from.</p>
<p>After a bit of experience with Clojure, I rarely have <em>difficult</em> problems with out-of-place <code>nil</code>s in pure Clojure code. However, there is often some Java interop--namely, calling Java methods directly--that will cause a NullPointerException if the object of the method call is <code>nil</code>. In these cases, wrapping a Java method call in a <code>(when )</code> is often appropriate. But sometimes not, and the NullPointerException is welcome.</p>
<p>There are some decisions in Clojure that I think make poor use of nil-punning. These places actually make working with Clojure more difficult than they need to be. For instance, <code>(str nil)</code> is the empty string. Printing this out prints nothing--a form of silence, which is rarely what you want so you have to check for <code>nil</code>s in these cases. But <code>nil</code> <em>is not</em> the empty string, like it is the empty <code>seq</code>. <code>(clojure.string/trim nil)</code> throws a NullPointerException. This is inconsistent behavior. <strong>When <code>nil</code> acts inconsistently, nil-punning does not work right. <code>nil</code>s need to be checked. In the worst cases, <code>nil</code>s fail silently.</strong> While I have learned to deal with these situations, they are a wart on the language. The fact that <code>nil</code>s are so common does help surface the bugs sooner. A small consolation.</p>
<p>Let me make it clear: null pointers are still a costly problem in Clojure. But I can make a claim similar to what Haskellers claim about the type system: <em>nil-punning eliminates a certain class of errors</em>. A fortuitous set of decisions in Clojure has reduced the magnitude of the problem. And some decisions have made the problem worse by hiding it. In general, I find that by <a href="http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp/Scheme-Ballad.text">embracing nil-punning</a>, my code gets better.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>Ring, the Clojure Web library, defines three main concepts that you use to construct web applications.</em></p>
<p>Ring is the center of the Clojure web universe. It's not the only option in town, but the other options refer to Ring to say how they are different. <strong>Understanding Ring will help you learn any other web system in Clojure.</strong></p>
<p>Ring has three main concepts that work together to build a web application.</p>

<p>I like to think of Ring Adapters as plug adapters. When you go to a different continent, you often have to adapt the holes in the electical outlet to fit your cords. Ring Adapters let you convert different web server implementations into a standard Ring Request/Response format. That way, all of your code is standardized to the Ring format. <strong>Your code can travel into any kind of server as long as an adapter exists.</strong></p>
<p>There are Ring Adapters for many existing servers.</p>

<h3 id="handlers">Handlers</h3>
<center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/handler.png" />
</center>

<p>Handlers do the work of your application. They are like the computer. They are just Clojure functions. HTTP is basically a request/response protocol that maps well to functions, which are just a protocol from argument to return value. <strong>Handlers take a Ring Request and return a Ring Response.</strong> They should do whatever logic is necessary for your application.</p>
<h3 id="middleware">Middleware</h3>
<center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/middleware.jpg" />
</center>

<p>Middleware are the voltage converters. Here in North America, wall sockets run at 120 volts, which is different from almost everywhere. In order to run an appliance from elsewhere, you not only need to adapt the socket, you also need to transform the current to a compatible voltage. <strong>Middleware are often used to convert the incoming request in some standard way.</strong> For instance, there is middleware to parse a JSON body into a Clojure map and store it away in the request.</p>
<p>The transformer also &quot;cleans up&quot; the current. Voltage spikes are evened out so they never get to the computer. <strong>Middleware can similarly protect a handler by making sure the browser is logged in.</strong></p>
<p>The analogy kind of breaks down, because middleware can do work (like the computer). Middleware are the hardest part of the Ring idea. They're not hard because the concept is hard. They're hard because <strong>they require design decisions</strong>. If all you had were Adapters and Handlers, you wouldn't have to think about where to put your logic. It would all go in the Handlers.</p>
<p>But there would be a lot of duplicated logic in your handlers. <strong>Authentication, routing, content-type switching, all of these things are done the same way over and over.</strong> It's the perfect problem for a little higher order programming. That's essentially what Middleware is.</p>
<p>Ring Middleware are functions that take a Handler and return a new Handler. Since Handlers are functions, <strong>Middleware are higher-order functions</strong>. The transformer on your computer's power cord takes a machine that requires a certain current and turns it into a machine that takes a different current. Middleware are used to do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>So, for instance, there's a Middleware called <a href="https://github.com/magnars/prone">Prone</a> that captures exceptions in the Handler and displays them in a nice format. Prone is a function that takes a Handler and returns a new Handler that catches exceptions and returns a different Ring Response in that case. Or you have Middleware that handle session cookies. <strong>The Middleware take a Handler and return a new Handler that understands sessions.</strong></p>
<p>My recommendation for what to put in Middleware versus what to put in Handlers is simplest to explain with a graph.</p>
<center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/handler-middleware.png" />
</center>

<p>Along the x-axis, we have logic that ranges from HTTP logic (handling header values, query params, etc.) to business logic (which bank account to withdraw from). Along the y-axis, we have how unique the logic is, ranging from highly duplicated to custom. <strong>These are the two axes I use to figure out whether it should be in the Handler or the Middleware.</strong></p>
<p>The clear cases are easy. In the upper right corner (red dot), where it's custom business logic, <strong>it's definitely in the Handler</strong>. In the lower left (blue dot), where it's duplicated HTTP logic, I prefer Middleware. <strong>The hard part is in the middle.</strong> Somewhere between those two, there's a fine line where a <strong>case-by-case decision is required</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Ring is great because it requires so few concepts to capture so much of HTTP. But it's not everything. Standard Ring does not support WebSockets, for instance. Small adaptations are necessary. In general, I think this is a great abstraction. <strong>And Ring is so central to Clojure on the Web, it's important to know.</strong></p>

<p>People have been asking me how they can get ready for all of the great talks lined up for <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a>. <strong>There are many topics, and people are feeling overwhelmed.</strong> They might know about some of the ideas, but not all of them.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to do just <strong>a little homework</strong> before the conj so that you would be sure to <strong>maximize your understanding</strong> and be able to participate in the conversations afterward?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, googling any topic reveals lots of material, and it's not always the best. <strong>It would take hours</strong> to sift through the background material for just one topic.</p>
<p>That's why I am publishing the Pre-conj Prep. Each day, I will send you <strong>one or two things to read or watch</strong> (whichever is better) to get up to speed on the topics of the talks (which are listed on the Clojure/conj speakers page). I'm used to finding great content for the Clojure Gazette, so you can be sure <strong>it will be helpful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conferences are ongoing conversations and explorations.</strong> Speakers discuss trends, best practices, and the future by drawing on the rich context built up in past conferences and other media. That rich context is what Pre-conj Prep is about. I want to enhance everyone's experience at the conj by surfacing that context. With just a little homework, we can be better prepared to <strong>understand and enjoy the talks and the hallway conversations</strong>.</p>
<p>There are 18 talks listed. After I go through all of them (that will take 18 days), I will go further than the published topics into other helpful stuff to get ready for a great <em>conj</em>. I am trying to get <strong>interviews with the speakers, restaurant/event/city guides, and more</strong>, to make the conference a special one.</p>

<p>The conj is a single-track conference, which means all talks happen in series in a single auditorium. The advantage of that is that <strong>everyone has a very similar experience</strong>. We all see the same talks (unless you skip one). The disadvantage is that you can't choose a different talk if you don't know about a topic. <strong>Preparation is key to having a great experience.</strong></p>
<p>As you probably know, conferences are social events. The talks are mostly an excuse to get together, meet each other, and talk about Clojure. The conversations that happen after a talk can be very rewarding. But if you don't understand why the topic is important, you may feel left out. Don't let that happen! <strong>You're travelling far and paying (or expensing) lots for the ticket, hotel, and travel.</strong> Make the most of it!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/moocar">Anthony Marcar</a> generously agreed to do an interview about his <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#amarcar">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a>. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-anthony-marcar">background to the talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Marcar</strong>: About 4 years ago, I decided that java wasn’t cutting it for me. I needed a new language, but I wanted to be on the JVM. So Scala and Clojure were the obvious contenders. I decided to spend 3 months building an online card game in both languages to see which I liked more. Scala at first was easier to get into, whereas Clojure was thoroughly alien. But over time, In Scala, I found I was spending more time building abstract Type graphs and waiting for compiles to finish, whereas in Clojure I was having a lot of fun and moving faster. I also loved the emphasis on immutability in Clojure. After that I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Clojure is relatively new, so you don't really get many experience reports of large production systems. When you hear someone talking about Clojure who has used it maybe only hobby projects or small projects, what are the common things that strike you as untrue?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: I don’t know if &quot;untrue&quot; is the right way to put it, but things people generally haven’t thought about before embarking on larger Clojure projects are things like how do you deploy your application, how do you go about logging and monitoring? How do you protect your application from going down if downstream dependencies start timing out? And how do you grow a code base across multiple projects? There still aren’t many resources in the Clojure space to answer these kinds of questions.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Have you had experience bringing programmers who don't know Clojure onto your team? What were the challenges? What surprised you?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: Yes I have had rubyists, node.js and python people join the team. Not surprisingly the JVM was a big challenge. Things like the local maven repository, logging, and common java libraries can be hard to grasp. I was however surprised how easily everyone picked up on Clojure’s fundamentals such as immutability. I guess it’s because that’s what attracted them to the language in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Do you think Clojure is a good fit for large companies with lots of software?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: Clojure is great for large companies. I think it’s greatest asset is its focus on data structures. In big companies, this is a big deal as there are layers and layers of legacy systems, each with their own outdated data formats and protocols. Clojure's focus on data transformations and concurrency makes it perfect for working with many different services to produce the right business outcome. That, combined with the the fact that it runs on the JVM makes it perfect for large companies.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Do you have any advice for the folks out there working for big companies who want to introduce Clojure to their work?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: If you want to introduce Clojure at a large company, get ready for a very tough road ahead. Work from both the bottom and top of the organization. Try and find the engineers who are always looking at new technologies. The kind who get home and build side projects. Then infect them. At the same time, scour the organization for VPs, or SVPs who &quot;get&quot; technologists. Buy them a beer. Ask them to be a champion for you, to protect you every time a more &quot;traditional&quot; team tries to block your progress. You’ll need all the help you can get and will have to work well past your normal hours, but it’s worth it.</p>
<p>If you want to take a shortcut, build a company that does Clojure, and then get acquired by said big company ;)</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: All I would add is that working in Clojure is extremely fun. If you’re not already working in it full time, go and apply for a job somewhere where you can!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: An ice cream sandwich. Because it’s awesome. That is all.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Elango Cheran was gracious enough to agree to an interview. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#echeran">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about using Clojure in other human languages. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-elango-cheran">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-elango-cheran">Interview with Elango Cheran</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Elango Cheran</strong>: I got into Clojure on the suggestion of a friend. At that point, I had been writing scripts in Python and some Ruby. I was setting off to create a cross-platform GUI desktop program using SWT, a Java UI framework. I had recently read press about Clojure, read a few Paul Graham essays, and had seen initial Clojure attempts at work, but after that, I was more skeptical about Clojure / Lisp than interested. I was thinking of using JRuby since Ruby was the most high-level language I had used by then, and I enjoyed it, entirely outside of Rails. A good friend suggested that I try Clojure instead for its elegant memory usage (via persistent data structures) and design for concurrency. As I started writing more Clojure code, the old fears faded, and I started surpassing my own expectations. I attribute the success to Clojure gently nudging me by design towards simpler, better code. It's been great fun and learning ever since.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Your talk is about adapting Clojure to work in foreign languages with different scripts. I can imagine it's very important to someone who doesn't speak English, but you probably have more insights into it. Can you speak to the difficulties someone might have with programming if they don't read/write English?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: Certainly, a lot of the tech world operates and communicates in English. I can explain the difficulties in 2 ways. First, if you can't read/write English, and want to learn programming, then you're limited to whatever resources exist in your mother tongue. From what I've seen for the Thamil language in my visits to India, even non-English resources rely on English eventually. Coining new words in another language to translate new English terms, in a fast-changing field like technology, is challenging enough. But if you want to teach coding, you have to revert to English for the source code examples regardless.</p>
<p>The other way of looking at it is from a native English speaker perspective: how old were we when we learned programming for the first time, and how hard was that? How old were we by the time we were fluent in a second language -- and fluent enough to use a computer and write code in it? I would bet that for many English speakers, programming fluency came first, and that would make sense to me. Computers and programming are tricky enough without the overhead of filtering the ideas through a second human language.</p>
<p>Currently, non-native speakers of English who learn technology are eventually bottlenecked by their ability to learn English, and learning English isn't uniformly accessible, either. Being able to write code in their first language could open up new doors, and I also think that Clojure currently would make for the easiest path to getting there.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: You mention that Clojure is well-suited to adapting to another human language. Why is that so?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: The things that make Clojure great for adapting to another human language are some of what make Clojure great as a programming language to begin with. Specific to another human language, the simplicity in the syntax is helpful in that there are less terms to translate, and the regularity of the syntax makes it easier as a beginner to wrap your head around. And more importantly, being able to extend the language without having to edit and re-compile the compiler is empowering. However, I wouldn't make any linguistic arguments in this regard -- 80+% of languages' sentence word order are either Subject-Verb-Object (e.g. English, Chinese) or Subject-Object-Verb (e.g. Thamil, Japanese), but Lisp puts the function (verb) at the beginning. Clojure targets popular runtimes (especially JVM and JavaScript), and the Clojure compiler and its target runtimes all support Unicode, which is the universal character set to represent the text of any language.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is the most interesting thing you have done with clj-thamil?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: I've written functions to implement various, basic Thamil language processing steps, like splitting a string into a seq of Thamil letters or phonemes, alphabetical sorting of strings, basic suffix-adding rules, and transliteration/character set conversions. Among other things, I've used clj-thamil along with Enlive to convert the Thamil text in an XHTML doc from a pre-Unicode character set to Unicode. I have ideas for wider-appeal applied uses in the future.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Are people writing Clojure in Thamil?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: It's just me at the moment, but I hope that improves! The simplicity of Clojure has made something that has been viewed up until now as tricky and largely unimplemented, like lexicographic Thamil text sorting, into 30 lines of Clojure. And Clojure targets Java (JVM) and JavaScript. Clojure's benefits are tremendous and speak for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: How can people help? What would be most helpful for you?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: The biggest help in terms of translating Clojure would be to figure out how to iron out a few details: how to get the reader to understand the translation for ns (or require, use, etc.), how to support translated literals (e.g. true, false, :else, numerals), and get the underlying JavaScript compiler to successfully run optimizations when identifiers are non-English. In terms of education, if we could modify clojail (used in tryclj.com) to use a JavaScript console widget that supports Unicode characters, it would provide an immediate way to experience Clojure in the language of your choice. After that, if we could translate turtle-based teaching languages, we can provide a platform for kids to learn programming in their own language.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it would be great to get help in refactoring and extending this project for other languages. Although each language has its own unique characteristics, many languages will share solutions, even in ways we don't necessarily expect.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you online?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: I'm <a href="https://github.com/echeran">@echeran</a> on Github, <a href="http://google.com/+ElangoCheran">+ElangoCheran</a> on Google Plus, and my blog is at <a href="http://www.elangocheran.com/blog">www.elangocheran.com/blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, it would be Sambar, a South Indian curry. It's tasty, has a lot of different good-for-you ingredients, it goes well with a lot of things, and I can eat it all day.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Tom Faulhaber is the next interview participant. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#tfaulhaber">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about using Clojure to create Excel spreadsheets. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-tom-faulhaber">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-tom-faulhaber">Interview with Tom Faulhaber</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Rich Hickey did a talk called “Clojure for Lisp Programmers.” I bookmarked that talk but avoided it because I was scared of it. The idea seemed too interesting and I was afraid I’d get sucked in.</p>
<p>But over Thanksgiving weekend 2009, I had some time and I watched the video. I <em>was</em> sucked in and I’ve been an active member of the Clojure community ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What other languages did you do before?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I’ve done them all. I’m a creature of the dark ages so I started with Basic, Cobol, Fortran and early Lisps. In the early part of my career, I worked on operating systems, data bases, and networking. This was all C and later C++. Nowadays, I do primarily Clojure and R along with some Python and Scala. One of the things I’ve learned is that there’s no silver bullet language: a clear understanding of of goals and good communication trump language choice every time.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What do you like best about Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I love Clojure, the language, but what I like even better is Clojure, the community. From the very beginning, Rich has worked hard to make sure it was a community of people that was positive towards each other.</p>
<p>Since then, more people have taken up the mantle of making Clojure more inclusive with initiatives like ClojureBridge and diversity scholarships. In addition to the folks using their own energy to make this happen, I have been very happy with the overall supportive tone in the community with respect to these efforts.</p>
<p>Like all tech communities, we clearly have a long way to go, but it’s hard not to be pleased that the community is receptive to these goals and always looking for ways to be better.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What advice do you give new clojure developers?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: This would be my advice for anyone learning a new language: human or computer. Take the language on its own terms and don’t try to enforce your own previous assumptions on it. For example, in Spanish the adjective usually comes after the noun. This causes a reaction in English speakers, who often think that Spanish gets it “wrong.” That’s not a productive approach to embracing the language (and, in fact, one reason to learn foreign languages is to experience those differences and thereby gain perspective).</p>
<p>In the case of Clojure, parenthesis, prefix notation, and lack of built-in typing come to the top of that list. When you’re learning Clojure, try really hard not to have negative opinions about these things. Accept what the experienced folks say is “best.” Later when you’re more familiar with the language, you’ll probably agree with the experts. But even if you don’t, it won’t be because you let yourself be blinded by where you came from.</p>
<p>Having said all that: <em>Do</em> use paredit. It makes dealing with the parentheses fade into the background and is available in most dev environments now.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What does your tooling look like? emacs or vim or ?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I’m an emacs user from way back. I’ve been very thankful for the work that Bozhidar Batsov, Phil Hagelberg and others have done over the years to make the Emacs Clojure environment so nice.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about creating spreadsheets in Excel, have you spent alot of time creating spreadsheets in other languages? what benefits do you get over using clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Yeah, a friend told me recently that I’ve been obsessed with Excel for a long time. I have used Excel natively and Excel from .Net (mostly through IronPython) to create live dashboards of systems and businesses in action without the overhead of building a website or buying an expensive tool.</p>
<p>I want to be able to use Excel for the things it’s good at and use Clojure for the things it’s good at. It turns out that they can go really well together.</p>
<p>For more on that, you’ll have to come to my talk which will involve live coding in <em>both</em> Clojure and Excel!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How would you use clojure to defeat the Kobayashi Maru ?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: That’s easy - use destructuring to get the Kobayashi Maru out of the neutral zone without entering it myself:</p>
<pre><code>(defn rescue-kobayashi-maru
  [neutral-zone]
  (let [{:keys [kobayashi-maru]} neutral-zone]
    kobayashi-maru))</code></pre>
<p>Back in the real world, I’ve found that Clojure’s capabilities to handle super-complex deeply nested data structures gets me out of scrapes that users of other languages thought were almost impossible to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: I had read much about it before, but Stephan Richter's demonstration of Clojure on app engine led me to binge listen to every Rich Hickey talk I could find. He had me at &quot;epochal time model&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: C++ python and a bit of php</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What advice do you have for beginner Clojure programmers?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Read lots of other peoples code and take the time to make at least one design as simple as you possibly can.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is your tooling like? emacs or vim or ?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: I started on vim moved to emacs for it's clojure support and now mostly use Cursive.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: You mention React in your talk description, are you using it in ClojureScript? What flavor of React are you using? (ie Om, Reagent, etc)</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: We use a modified version of Quiescent. I think all the React from Clojure work will eventually grow together into a set of functions and a common macro used to generate the react class directly.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How would you use Clojure to defeat the kobayashi maru?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Persistent data structures of course</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jhume">John Hume's talk</a> at Clojure/West is about Clojure internals.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>You can get a lot done in Clojure without understanding much about its internals. But when your code doesn't do what you expect, whether in terms of behavior or performance, it can be extremely useful to dig into the underlying Java code.</p>
<p>John's presentation will walk the audience through some of that code by following a simple map-literal expression through Clojure's reader and analyzer, particularly focusing on code generation in <code>clojure.lang.Compiler</code>, and then onto runtime evaluation. The hope is that you'll come out of the talk better able to analyze what's really happening in your own Clojure code.</p>
