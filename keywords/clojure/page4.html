<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#sjohnson">Sean Johnson's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about pattern matching in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>The built-in pattern matching in Clojure is not as powerful as in Haskell and Erlang. But, being a Lisp, it's easy to write a pattern matching macro. Which has been done, it's called <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.match">core.match</a>, and it's great. This talk is an experience report from using pattern matching in Clojure. Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/27860102">Pattern Matching &amp; Predicate Dispatch</a>, a talk by core.match's creator, David Nolen.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure's prowess in the world of data and distributed systems is pretty awesome. This talk is about two open source libraries for crunching lots of data in Clojure. One is called <a href="https://github.com/yieldbot/marceline">marceline</a>, the other is <a href="https://github.com/yieldbot/flambo">flambo</a>. Both are wrappers for distributed computation libraries.

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#ttallman">Tyler Tallman's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about how to model complex problems in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Medical care is incredibly complex, and is only getting worse. Most medical record software is like a basic CRUD app. It stores the information the doctor puts in and displays it when asked. But as the amount of information increases, something more needs to happen. How can the computer system support the doctor making ever more complex decisions? How can it support the host of medical professionals that provide care? And what role can Clojure play in that process?</p>
<p>I don't have any background information for this one. But I know Tyler personally and this is a fascinating story of rules engines, complex data formats, visualizations, and composable abstractions.</p>

              Ring 1.3
            </a>
          </h2>

          <div class="timestamp">
            July 22, 2014
          </div>

          
<p>Summary: <em>Ring is great because it closely models the HTTP message format using native Clojure data structures. It strictly defines a message format that any software can use and rely on. With Ring 1.3, the specification has gotten even closer to the HTTP spec.</em></p>
<p>A couple of months ago, Ring 1.3 was released without much fanfare. It included a few improvements and updates, but in general, not much had changed.</p>
<p>One change, though, is very significant: the specification is <em>shorter</em>. It's simpler. Three keys were deprecated in the Ring request map (<code>:content-type</code>, <code>:content-length</code>, and <code>:character-encoding</code>). <strong>These keys were unnecessary because their values were in the headers</strong>, which are also in the Ring request. Equivalent utility functions have been added for pulling the data out of the headers.</p>
<p>Why is this important? While many libraries get more complex and overburdened, <strong>it is refreshing to see a library going in the correct direction of <em>shedding complexity</em></strong>. It does not significantly impact application development. Nor does it reduce the already low barrier to entry. Still, I welcome this kind of change.</p>
<p><strong>Ring is the central specification that ties most of the Clojure web ecosystem together.</strong> The spec <em>should</em> be minimal. <strong>And a mark of good software is that it models the problem very closely without unnecessary abstraction.</strong> Ring merely defines a common format (using Clojure data structures) that mirrors the text-based HTTP message format. That's why Ring has worked so well thus far and why it is appreciated in Clojure.</p>
<p>Because I was so happy about the change, I decided to update my <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/ring-spec-hang-on-wall">Ring Spec to Hang on the Wall PDF</a>. The newly deprecated keys are gone. It used to be two pages long. The Ring Request took up an entire page, and the Response took up about half of one. But now, with three keys removed and a little tweaking of the font sizes, <strong>everything fits on one page</strong>.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>The Ring SPEC is the core of the Clojure web ecosystem. The standard is small and <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/web-dev-in-clojure#subscribe">a reference</a> is handy.</em></p>
<p>If you program the web in Clojure, you probably use Ring. Even if you don't, your server is likely <a href="http://http-kit.org/">Ring compatible</a>.</p>
<p>Ring has a small SPEC. It's centered around defining the keys one can expect in the request and response maps. And the exact names for keywords are easy to forget.</p>
<p>I don't want to forget. I use Ring often enough that I want a quick reference. A while ago, I printed out a quick summary of the keys for the request and response maps and hung it on the wall behind my monitor. I refer to it frequently.</p>
<p>If you program the web in Clojure, you might appreciate this printout. If you're learning, it could be an invaluable reference. <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/web-dev-in-clojure#subscribe">Please download the PDF.</a></p>

              TDD Workflow in Clojure using Emacs with CIDER
            </a>
          </h2>

          <div class="timestamp">
            June 08, 2015
          </div>

          
<p>Summary: <em>TDD is about fast feedback. CIDER tightens the feedback loop with quick commands for running tests and a powerful test reporting system.</em></p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>I've always been into flow. One of the key aspects of flow is a short feedback loop. Test Driven Development (TDD) is partially based on flow, too. You write a new test, then you write code to satisfy the test, then you refactor. You cycle quickly with very small steps. Great for flow!</p>
<p>Now, I'm not going to be a pedant in this post about what is and what is not TDD. Sometimes I like to adhere to a strict discipline of TDD. And sometimes I like to code fast and loose. But as a working definition, for the purposes of this article, I'll define TDD as writing code and tests incrementally, and running the tests fairly often. <strong>The last thing you want is to have to wait for those tests to run.</strong></p>
<p>Luckily, CIDER<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> has been optimized to make the whole process smooth, fast, and feedbacky. You can learn about installing CIDER <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/wiki/Installation">here</a>. Or <script type="text/javascript">
<!--

document.write('<a h'+'ref'+'="ma'+'ilto'+':'+e+'">'+'ask me any time for help'+'<\/'+'a'+'>');
// -->
</script><noscript>&#x61;&#x73;&#x6b;&#32;&#x6d;&#x65;&#32;&#x61;&#110;&#x79;&#32;&#116;&#x69;&#x6d;&#x65;&#32;&#102;&#x6f;&#114;&#32;&#104;&#x65;&#108;&#112;&#32;&#40;&#x65;&#114;&#x69;&#x63;&#32;&#x61;&#116;&#32;&#108;&#x69;&#x73;&#112;&#x63;&#x61;&#x73;&#116;&#32;&#100;&#x6f;&#116;&#32;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#x29;</noscript> if you run into trouble.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h3>
<p>First, you'll need CIDER connected to the REPL (usually just <code>C-c M-j</code>).</p>
<p>Besides the basic commands for switching buffers (<code>C-c b</code>), I use just one command a ton while I'm TDD'ing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-c ,</code> (That's Control-c comma.) While you're in a buffer, it will run the tests for that buffer. It could be that you're in production code, in which case it will try to find the <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/clojure-test-directory">corresponding test namespace</a> and run tests there.</li>
</ul>
<p>That will give you just the feedback you need: a green status report in the status bar if everything passes. And a new buffer with a <strong>failure and error report</strong> if it's not passing. You can do some cool stuff in that buffer, like jumping to the test definition, rerunning individual tests, and seeing diffs of actual vs. expected output. Look <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider#cider-test-report-mode">here</a> for a quick reference to the available key bindings.</p>
<p>But mostly I'm editing code, compiling it (with <code>C-c C-k</code>), and running the tests (<code>C-c ,</code>) to make sure they pass now. Unlike with running <code>lein test</code> at the command line, this command <strong>only runs the tests for that specific namespace</strong>. This is usually what you want while you're editing code in the namespace. After you're done, you'll want to rerun all of the tests in a fresh JVM at the command line.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Getting a productive workflow set up is really important. It's hard on our nerves to be waiting through long feedback cycles. <strong>CIDER tightens those loops</strong> down to human scale so we can focus on the work of making the world better.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more about testing in Clojure, including how to write tests so that they work seamlessly with Leiningen and CIDER, I have to recommend my <a href="http://purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure-test">LispCast Intro to clojure.test</a> course.

              Token Buckets with core.async

<p>Summary: <em>Token Bucket is a simple algorithm for rate limiting a resource. It's easy to understand because you can reason about it in terms of real-world objects. core.async makes this algorithm very clear and easy.</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/token%20bucket.png" alt="Token + BucketImage credits: token and bucket." /><p class="caption">Token + Bucket<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>You know you've got a good abstraction when you find lots of algorithms that are easy and clear to write using them. One algorithm that I really like because it's <strong>practical and simple</strong> is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket">Token Bucket</a>. It's used for <strong>rate limiting a resource</strong>. And it's very easy to write in core.async.</p>
<p>Let me digress a little. Here in the US, we have a complicated voting system. Not only do your presidential votes count only indirectly, but the counting is done with machines that vary from state to state. Some of those systems are so complicated. It's a little scary because it's hard to know how those machines work.</p>
<p>I mean, relatively hard. It's obviously possible to know, if you study enough. But <strong>compare it to papers in a box</strong>. I know there's all sorts of room for corruption in the papers in a box system. But it's understandable by children. Well, as long as they can count.</p>
<p>The token bucket is similarly simple. There's a bucket. You put tokens in it at a certain rate (for instance, once per hour). If you have a token, you can take an action (ride the subway, send a packet, read a file), then you lose the token (it's good for one ride). If you don't have a token, you can wait. <strong>Everything slows down to the rate of tokens falling into the bucket.</strong></p>
<p>It's so simple. It so easily <strong>corresponds to a real-world situation</strong> you can imagine. I love that type of algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="an-implementation">An implementation</h3>
<p>Let's build Token Bucket in core.async.</p>
<p>First, we need a bucket. For that, we'll use a core.async channel with a buffer. Let's just start with size 10.</p>
<pre><code>(def bucket (chan 10))</code></pre>
<p>Bucket is done. Now, we need something to <strong>add tokens to the bucket at a given rate</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>(go
  (while true
    (&gt;! bucket :token)
    (&lt;! (timeout 1000))))</code></pre>
<p>That will add one token to the bucket every second.</p>
<p>We can rate limit an existing channel by <strong>forcing it to take a token before values get through</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>(defn limit-rate [c]
  (let [out (chan)]
    (go
      (loop []
        (let [v (&lt;! c)]
          (if (nil? v) ;; c is closed
            (close! out)
            (do
              (&lt;! bucket) ;; wait for a token
              (&gt;! out v)
              (recur))))))
    out))</code></pre>
<h3 id="corner-cases">Corner cases</h3>
<p>Ok, it's not that simple. There are two corner cases.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What happens when nobody takes a token out of the bucket? Do you keep putting coins in?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer is yes. In the next hour, there are two tokens, so two can come through. But then . . .</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What do you do when the bucket gets really full and a whole bunch of people take tokens out at the same time?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, you let them all through. One token, one ride. There's no other coordination. And that means it's really important to choose the size of your bucket.</p>
<p>The number of tokens your bucket can hold is called the <em>burstiness</em>. It's because when the bucket is full, you could get a rampage of people trying to get on the subway. How many people should be allowed through at that point? <strong>The burstiness is the maximum that should come through at a time.</strong></p>
<p>We have our two parameters: the <em>rate</em> and the <em>burstiness</em>. Let's incorporate all of that.</p>
<pre><code>(defn limit-rate [c r b]
  (let [bucket (chan b) ;; burstiness
        out (chan)]
    (go
      (while true
        (&gt;! bucket :token)
        (&lt;! (timeout (int (/ 1000 r)))))) ;; rate
    (go
      (loop []
        (let [v (&lt;! c)]
          (if (nil? v) ;; channel is closed
            (close! out)
            (do
              (&lt;! bucket) ;; wait for a token
              (&gt;! out v)
              (recur))))))
    out))</code></pre>
<p>The burstiness is taken care of in the size of the buffer. The buffer will fill up if no one takes a token. Since we're using blocking buffers, <strong>putting tokens into a full bucket will block</strong> until something takes a token--exactly as the algorithm describes.</p>
<p>Well, that's it. It's easy. And now <strong>we have a way to limit the rate of a channel</strong>. We can use it to limit the rates of other things, too, like a function call or access to a database. I use it to rate limit an API.</p>
<p>core.async makes this algorithm nice and easy to use. There's a library that does this for you in a very convenient package. It's called <a href="https://github.com/brunoV/throttler">Throttler</a>. Bruno Vecchi has done the work of making this work well as a library. If you'd like to learn core.async, I recommend my <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/core-async">LispCast Clojure core.async videos</a>. It's a gentle and fun introduction to a great topic. You will learn everything you need to write Token Bucket and more!</p>

<p>Summary: <em>There are many great resources out there for learning Clojure. Some of the resources are paid, but fortunately many of the best resources are absolutely free.</em></p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in learning Clojure?</strong> Would you like to get started without risking your money on a book? Is there something that can help you even know whether you want to learn Clojure?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>I learned Clojure for free. In fact, I'm a bit of a cheapskate. For many years I would avoid spending money if there was a free alternative. I also keep an eye on resources that pop up around the internet.</p>
<p>I have assembled what I believe to be the best resources to start with if you want to get into Clojure but want to spend $0.</p>

              Example-based Unit Testing in Clojure
            </a>

<p>Summary: <em>Unit testing in Clojure is straightforward. Here are a few testing ideas as they apply to Clojure.</em></p>
<p>Most of the Unit Testing literature discusses how to unit test Object Oriented code. However, Unit Testing is very useful for functional code, including Clojure. <strong>I'd like to document a few unit testing ideas as they relate to Clojure.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-unit-youre-testing-is-the-function">The Unit you're testing is the function</h3>
<p>Unit testing is about testing the smallest unit of code. In Object Oriented languages, the unit is the class. In functional languages, <strong>the unit is typically the function</strong>. This is true in Clojure. If you're testing individual functions, you're unit testing Clojure.</p>
<h3 id="example-based-tests">Example-based tests</h3>
<p>The easiest kind of tests to do is example-based, which means you test that <strong>for a given argument, you get a known return value</strong>. Let's look at a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>(deftest addition-tests
  (is (= 5 (+ 3 2)))
  (is (= 10 (+ 5 5))))</code></pre>
<p>You're testing that <code>+</code> works on two different inputs! Notice: 2 lines and 2 inputs, it looks like we'll get <strong>linear growth in tests as our coverage increases</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="round-trip-testing">Round-trip testing</h3>
<p>Ok, it's not exactly unit testing, if you are strictly going by the definition of &quot;unit&quot;, because you're actually testing <em>two</em> functions. But who's really being so strict? A really <em>useful</em> kind of test is the <strong>round-trip test</strong>.</p>
<p>In Clojure, <code>pr-str</code> prints a value readably, meaning if the value <em>can</em> be read back in, this will make a string that could be read in using <code>clojure.edn/read-string</code>. You can do a round-trip from value to string back to value, and the two values should be equal. <strong>You're testing the property that these two functions are inverses of each other.</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(deftest pr-str-read-string-round-trip
  (is (= [1 2 3] (read-string (pr-str [1 2 3]))))
  (is (= {:a :b :c :d} (read-string (pr-str {:a :b :c :d})))))</code></pre>
<p>Again, we're getting <strong>linear test growth</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's another example where I test that addition is the opposite of subtraction:</p>
<pre><code>(deftest +---round-trip
  (is (= 5 (-&gt; 5 (+ 10) (- 10))))
  (is (= 10 (-&gt; 10 (+ 100) (- 100)))))</code></pre>
<h3 id="what-examples-to-test">What examples to test</h3>
<p>If you're writing example-based tests one-by-one, and you're getting linear benefit for your examples, you've really <strong>got to maximize what you test</strong>, because linear growth is actually quite bad. In that case, what do you test? The best thing to test are the corner cases. Corner cases are mostly domain-dependent, but there are some domain-independent ones.</p>
<h4 id="empty-collections">Empty collections</h4>
<p>It's good to test what happens when you call a function on an empty collection. It could be that you didn't handle that, or didn't handle it correctly. The biggest gotcha is stuff like dividing by the size of the collection. If it's empty, the size is zero, and that's undefined.</p>
<h4 id="empty-strings">Empty strings</h4>
<p>The bane of the web programmer's existence, empty strings are usually not valid input, but of course that doesn't stop someone from passing one in. Are you testing that it's valid?</p>
<h4 id="zero">Zero</h4>
<p>Zero is actually a typical corner case. Try it out.</p>
<h4 id="one">One</h4>
<p>One is also a typical corner case.</p>
<h4 id="normal-cases">Normal cases</h4>
<p>You should have at least one normal case to test the expected behavior. A normal case is a list with 5 elements, or a small integer (7, 12, 34).</p>
<h4 id="bugs">Bugs</h4>
<p>Now, here's the thing that makes having a test system set up totally worth it: <strong>having a place to put tests for known and fixed bugs</strong>. If someone reports a bug, it's really nice to reproduce it in code in a failing test <em>before</em> you fix it. If the bug happened once, it could happen again, so make it part of your anti-regression suite.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-assertions-on-the-return-value">Multiple assertions on the return value</h3>
<p>One last thing that happens in Clojure is you want to assert a few things about the same return value. Instead of calling the function several times, why not save the value and assert a few things about it?</p>
<pre><code>(deftest map-test
  (let [return (map - [1 2 3 4 5 6 7])]
    (is (= 7 (count return)))
    (is (every? neg? return))))</code></pre>
<h3 id="one-step-further">One step further</h3>
<p>Ok, I've mentioned a few times that example-based testing does not scale. Code coverage grows linearly as the number of examples grows. How do you get better than linear? One way is to use <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">property-based testing</a> (also known as generative testing). Instead of the programmer giving examples, the program generates examples! Here's a preview:</p>
<pre><code>(defspec edn-roundtrips 50
  (prop/for-all [a gen/any]
    (= a (-&gt; a prn-str edn/read-string))))</code></pre>
<p>This tests that any value (<code>gen/any</code>) can be printed to a string and read back in, and you get an equivalent value. Three lines. You can run this with as many randomly generated values as you'd like. Thousands. Millions. With three lines. That's leverage.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ok, those are just a few ideas that could <strong>get you started with example-based unit testing in Clojure</strong>. If you'd like to start automated testing in Clojure, I suggest you check out <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Intro to clojure.test</a>. <code>clojure.test</code> is the built-in, standard Clojure testing library that most systems use (or are compatible with). The LispCast course is an interactive course with animation, examples, screencasts, text, code samples, and more!</p>
<p>Now, if you'd like to up your game at testing, and want to get more than linear bang for your buck, you've got to get into <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">generative testing</a>.</p>
