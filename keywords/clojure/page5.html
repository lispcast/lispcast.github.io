<p>Summary: <em>There are many great resources out there for learning Clojure. Some of the resources are paid, but fortunately many of the best resources are absolutely free.</em></p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in learning Clojure?</strong> Would you like to get started without risking your money on a book? Is there something that can help you even know whether you want to learn Clojure?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>I learned Clojure for free. In fact, I'm a bit of a cheapskate. For many years I would avoid spending money if there was a free alternative. I also keep an eye on resources that pop up around the internet.</p>

            Example-based Unit Testing in Clojure
          </a>

<p>Summary: <em>Unit testing in Clojure is straightforward. Here are a few testing ideas as they apply to Clojure.</em></p>
<p>Most of the Unit Testing literature discusses how to unit test Object Oriented code. However, Unit Testing is very useful for functional code, including Clojure. <strong>I'd like to document a few unit testing ideas as they relate to Clojure.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-unit-youre-testing-is-the-function">The Unit you're testing is the function</h3>
<p>Unit testing is about testing the smallest unit of code. In Object Oriented languages, the unit is the class. In functional languages, <strong>the unit is typically the function</strong>. This is true in Clojure. If you're testing individual functions, you're unit testing Clojure.</p>
<h3 id="example-based-tests">Example-based tests</h3>
<p>The easiest kind of tests to do is example-based, which means you test that <strong>for a given argument, you get a known return value</strong>. Let's look at a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>(deftest addition-tests
  (is (= 5 (+ 3 2)))
  (is (= 10 (+ 5 5))))</code></pre>
<p>You're testing that <code>+</code> works on two different inputs! Notice: 2 lines and 2 inputs, it looks like we'll get <strong>linear growth in tests as our coverage increases</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="round-trip-testing">Round-trip testing</h3>
<p>Ok, it's not exactly unit testing, if you are strictly going by the definition of &quot;unit&quot;, because you're actually testing <em>two</em> functions. But who's really being so strict? A really <em>useful</em> kind of test is the <strong>round-trip test</strong>.</p>
<p>In Clojure, <code>pr-str</code> prints a value readably, meaning if the value <em>can</em> be read back in, this will make a string that could be read in using <code>clojure.edn/read-string</code>. You can do a round-trip from value to string back to value, and the two values should be equal. <strong>You're testing the property that these two functions are inverses of each other.</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(deftest pr-str-read-string-round-trip
  (is (= [1 2 3] (read-string (pr-str [1 2 3]))))
  (is (= {:a :b :c :d} (read-string (pr-str {:a :b :c :d})))))</code></pre>
<p>Again, we're getting <strong>linear test growth</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's another example where I test that addition is the opposite of subtraction:</p>
<pre><code>(deftest +---round-trip
  (is (= 5 (-&gt; 5 (+ 10) (- 10))))
  (is (= 10 (-&gt; 10 (+ 100) (- 100)))))</code></pre>
<h3 id="what-examples-to-test">What examples to test</h3>
<p>If you're writing example-based tests one-by-one, and you're getting linear benefit for your examples, you've really <strong>got to maximize what you test</strong>, because linear growth is actually quite bad. In that case, what do you test? The best thing to test are the corner cases. Corner cases are mostly domain-dependent, but there are some domain-independent ones.</p>
<h4 id="empty-collections">Empty collections</h4>
<p>It's good to test what happens when you call a function on an empty collection. It could be that you didn't handle that, or didn't handle it correctly. The biggest gotcha is stuff like dividing by the size of the collection. If it's empty, the size is zero, and that's undefined.</p>
<h4 id="empty-strings">Empty strings</h4>
<p>The bane of the web programmer's existence, empty strings are usually not valid input, but of course that doesn't stop someone from passing one in. Are you testing that it's valid?</p>
<h4 id="zero">Zero</h4>
<p>Zero is actually a typical corner case. Try it out.</p>
<h4 id="one">One</h4>
<p>One is also a typical corner case.</p>
<h4 id="normal-cases">Normal cases</h4>
<p>You should have at least one normal case to test the expected behavior. A normal case is a list with 5 elements, or a small integer (7, 12, 34).</p>
<h4 id="bugs">Bugs</h4>
<p>Now, here's the thing that makes having a test system set up totally worth it: <strong>having a place to put tests for known and fixed bugs</strong>. If someone reports a bug, it's really nice to reproduce it in code in a failing test <em>before</em> you fix it. If the bug happened once, it could happen again, so make it part of your anti-regression suite.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-assertions-on-the-return-value">Multiple assertions on the return value</h3>
<p>One last thing that happens in Clojure is you want to assert a few things about the same return value. Instead of calling the function several times, why not save the value and assert a few things about it?</p>
<pre><code>(deftest map-test
  (let [return (map - [1 2 3 4 5 6 7])]
    (is (= 7 (count return)))
    (is (every? neg? return))))</code></pre>
<h3 id="one-step-further">One step further</h3>
<p>Ok, I've mentioned a few times that example-based testing does not scale. Code coverage grows linearly as the number of examples grows. How do you get better than linear? One way is to use <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">property-based testing</a> (also known as generative testing). Instead of the programmer giving examples, the program generates examples! Here's a preview:</p>
<pre><code>(defspec edn-roundtrips 50
  (prop/for-all [a gen/any]
    (= a (-&gt; a prn-str edn/read-string))))</code></pre>
<p>This tests that any value (<code>gen/any</code>) can be printed to a string and read back in, and you get an equivalent value. Three lines. You can run this with as many randomly generated values as you'd like. Thousands. Millions. With three lines. That's leverage.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ok, those are just a few ideas that could <strong>get you started with example-based unit testing in Clojure</strong>. If you'd like to start automated testing in Clojure, I suggest you check out <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Intro to clojure.test</a>. <code>clojure.test</code> is the built-in, standard Clojure testing library that most systems use (or are compatible with). The LispCast course is an interactive course with animation, examples, screencasts, text, code samples, and more!</p>
<p>Now, if you'd like to up your game at testing, and want to get more than linear bang for your buck, you've got to get into <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">generative testing</a>.</p>

            What Web Framework Should I Use in Clojure?

<p>Summary: <em>There are a number of web frameworks in Clojure, but beginners should roll their own server stack themselves to tap into the Ring ecosystem.</em></p>
<p>One question that I am asked a lot by beginners in Clojure is <strong>&quot;What web framework should I use?&quot;</strong> This is a good question. In Python, there's Django. In PHP, Drupal. And of course in Ruby, there's the king of all web frameworks, Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>What framework should you use in Clojure? The question is actually kind of hard to answer. There are a number of web frameworks out there. Some people call <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> a framework, though it is really a library. <a href="https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir">lib-noir</a> does a lot of work for you. Then there's your true frameworks, like <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal">Pedestal</a> or <a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a>, which provide infrastructure and abstractions for tackling web development. All of these projects are great, but for a beginner, <strong>I have to recommend building your own web stack starting with Ring</strong>.</p>
<p>Compojure is really just a routing library, not a framework. You can use it for your routing needs, though there are alternatives, such as <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/playnice">playnice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/juxt/bidi">bidi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clojurewerkz/route-one">Route One</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thatismatt/gudu">gudu</a>. <strong>If you don't want to decide, use Compojure. It's widely used and works great.</strong> If you want to go in depth, read the docs for the others. They are each good for different cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir">lib-noir</a> comes from <a href="http://www.webnoir.org/">Noir</a>, which was a web framework (now deprecated). It was easy and provided a bit of plumbing already built for you, so you could just start a project with a lot of the infrastructure built in. lib-noir is that infrastructure in library form. I haven't used it, but a lot of people like it. However, when I look at it, I see that <strong>most of what it provides I either won't use or it is trivial to add myself</strong>. That would normally be ok if there was huge adoption for it (like with Rails) so you get an ecosystem effect, but there isn't. <strong>lib-noir is used but certainly not dominant.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal">Pedestal</a> has a lot of backing. It aims to tackle single-page apps by providing a sane front-end environment using ClojureScript in the form of a message queue. If you're into &quot;real-time apps&quot;, this may be for you. Though, I would caution you that it's not for a Clojure beginner. <strong>Pedestal introduces a lot of new concepts that even experienced Clojure programmers have to learn.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/app-tutorial/wiki">tutorial</a> is long and arduous. You will have problems learning Pedestal without knowing Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pedestal-users/jODwmJUIUcg">Pedestal has changed dramatically</a> since I last looked at it. It is no longer a frontend framework. It is now a high-performance backend server for high performance asynchronous processing. It's worth looking at if you need that. Otherwise, I stick with my recommendation to use basic Ring.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a> is also designed for web apps. It gives you a DOM written in ClojureScript (including custom components), dataflow programming (like a spreadsheet), and client-server communication. It's a bold step, but again, <strong>requires you to buy into programming models that will take a long time to understand</strong>. If you are not already familiar with Clojure, you are asking for trouble.</p>
<p>There are other frameworks out there. But I recommend rolling your own stack. If you're learning Clojure, <strong>the best way to grasp how web apps work is to get a <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> Jetty adapter set up with some basic handlers</strong>. Add existing middleware as you need it. Write some middleware of your own. Use Compojure to route. Use <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a> to generate HTML. <strong>That setup will get you a long way.</strong></p>
<p>Ring is just functions. With a few basic concepts and a copy of the Ring SPEC handy, you can build a web server very quickly that does exactly what you want and <strong>you can understand every aspect of it</strong>. The experience of building one yourself can teach you a lot about how the other frameworks are put together.</p>
<p>What's more, Ring <em>is</em> dominant. Most people write functionality (in the form of middleware and handlers) assuming Ring and no more. So by staying close to the metal, you are <strong>tapping into a huge resevoir of pre-written libraries that are all compatible with each other</strong>. Ring is the locus for the Clojure web ecosystem.</p>
<p>Wiring up your own middleware stack is not that daunting. If you want guidance, <strong>my <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/web-dev-in-clojure">Web Development in Clojure video series</a> is now for sale</strong>. It starts with a brand new Clojure project and ends with a fully functional app, backed by a database, and hosted on Heroku (for free!). In one hour, <strong>it explains all the concepts and shows you lots of examples</strong>. There's lots of exercises to get your brain whirring.</p>
<p>Recommended stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> (with Jetty adapter)
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.params.html#var-wrap-params">wrap-params</a> (parsing params)</li>

            When To Use a Macro in Clojure

<p>Summary: <em>Macros should be avoided to the extent possible. There are three circumstances where they are required.</em></p>
<p>There's a common theme in Lisp that you should only use macros when you need them. <strong>It is very common to see a new lisper overuse macros.</strong> I did it myself when I first learned Lisp. They are very powerful and make you the king of syntax.</p>
<p>Clojure macros do have their uses, but why should you avoid them if possible? The principle reason is that <strong>macros are not first-class in Clojure</strong>. You cannot access them at runtime. You cannot pass them as an argument to a function, nor do any of the other powerful stuff you've come to love from functional programming. In short, <strong>macros are not functional programming</strong> (though they can make use of it).</p>
<p>A function, on the other hand, is a first-class value, and so is available for awesome functional programming constructs. <strong>You should prefer functions to macros.</strong></p>
<p>That said, macros are still useful because there are things macros can do that functions cannot. <strong>What are the powers of a macro that are unavailable to any other construct in Clojure?</strong> If you <em>need</em> any of these abilities, write a macro.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-has-to-run-at-compile-time">1. The code has to run at compile time</h3>
<p>There are just some things that need to happen at compile time. I recently wrote a macro that returns the hash of the current git commit so that the hash can be embedded in the ClojureScript compilation. This needs to be done at compile time because the script will be run somewhere else, where it cannot get the commit hash. Another example is <strong>performing expensive calculations at compile time as an optimization</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro build-time []
  (str (java.util.Date.)))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>build-time</code> macro returns a String representation of the time it is run.</p>
<p><strong>Running code at compile time is not possible in anything other than macros.</strong></p>
<h3 id="you-need-access-to-unevaled-arguments">2. You need access to unevaled arguments</h3>
<p>Macros are useful for writing <strong>new, convenient syntactic constructs</strong>. And when we talk about syntax, we are typically talking about raw, <strong>unevaluated sexpressions</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro when
  &quot;Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do.&quot;
  {:added &quot;1.0&quot;}
  [test &amp; body]
  (list &#39;if test (cons &#39;do body)))</code></pre>
<p><code>clojure.core/when</code> is a syntactic sugar macro which transforms into an <code>if</code> with a <code>do</code> for a <em>then</em> and no <em>else</em>. The <code>body</code> should not be evaled before the <code>test</code> is checked.</p>
<p>Getting access to the unevaluated arguments is available by quoting (<code>'</code> or <code>(quote ...)</code>), but that is <strong>often unacceptable for syntactic constructs</strong>. Macros are the only way to do that.</p>
<h3 id="you-need-to-emit-inline-code">3. You need to emit inline code</h3>
<p>Sometimes calling a function is unacceptable. That call is either too expensive or is otherwise not the behavior you want.</p>
<p>For instance, in Javascript in the browser, you can call <code>console.log('msg')</code> to print out a message and the line number to the console. In ClojureScript, this becomes something like this: <code>(.log js/console &quot;msg&quot;)</code>. Not convenient at all. <strong>My first thought was to create a function.</strong><sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>(defn log [msg]
  (.log js/console msg))</code></pre>
<p>This worked alright for printing the message, but the line numbers were all pointing to the same line: the body of the function! <code>console.log</code> records the line exactly where it is called, so <strong>it needs to be inline</strong>. I replaced it with a macro, which highlights its purpose as syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro log [msg]
  `(.log js/console ~msg))</code></pre>
<p>The body replaces the call to log, so <strong>it is located where it is needed for the proper behavior.</strong></p>
<p>If you need <strong>inline code</strong>, a macro is the only way.</p>
<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p>Of course, <strong>any combination of these is also acceptable</strong>. And don't forget that although you might need a macro, macros are only available at compile time. So you should consider <strong>providing a function that does the same thing</strong> and then wrap it with a macro.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Macros are very powerful. Their power comes with a price: they are only available at compile time. Because of that, functions should be preferred to macros. The use of macros should be reserved for those special occasions when their power is needed.</p>

<p>Way back in May 2012, Ambrose was beginning work on Typed Clojure for Google Summer of Code. I interviewed him to get an idea of what kind of type system we could expect. Since he's now running a very successful <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/typed-clojure">crowd funding campaign</a>, I thought I'd bring up this blast from the past.</p>
