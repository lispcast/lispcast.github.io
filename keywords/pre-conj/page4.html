<h3 id="talk-generating-generatorstalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#steve-miner">Generating Generators</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#steve-miner">Steve Miner's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about automatically creating test.check generators from a data-driven schema.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Steve Miner is the author of the <a href="https://github.com/miner/herbert">Herbert</a> schema library. In Herbert, schemas are presented as plain EDN. They describe the structure and type of data. You can take a value and validate that it conforms to the schema. He is going to present a way to generate test.check generators from the schema. This way, you can do runtime checks and test-time checks. A good intro to Herbert is <a href="http://youtu.be/bmHTFo2Rf2w?t=19m50s">Steve Miner's lightning talk</a> from Clojure/conj last year. Reid Draper gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMhNINPo__g">talk about test.check at Clojure/West</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>test.check contains a set of combinators to create new generators from existing generators. But combinators are not very easy to read or write when the data they are generating is fairly complex. Being able to generate them automatically from a declarative, data-driven style is one way to make it easier.</p>
<p>Besides being easier, it also unifies the contracts (schema validation in function preconditions) with generative testing. The next domino would have to be building core.typed type signatures from the same data.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#steven-yi">Steven Yi's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about music systems on the JVM, focusing on two systems he built, called Pink and Score.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kunstmusik/pink">Pink</a> is a library for signal generation and processing and event handling. It is designed as a low-level library to use to build your own audio system. It is written in Clojure.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kunstmusik/score">Score</a> is a library for composing musical scores. Those scores are generic, so that they can be played by a variety of backend systems. Score is written in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Electronic music is an interesting field. It is one that Lisp has been applied to for many years. To paraphrase <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/">Sam Aaron</a>, creator of <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>, Clojure's high-level allows a programmer to leverage programming ability to create better music. Pink and Score join Overtone and Rich Hickey's <a href="https://github.com/richhickey/harmonikit">Harmonikit</a> as music systems developed in Clojure.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#zach-oakes">Zach Oakes' talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about making games in a dynamic programming environment.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure, and Lisps in general, are famous for dynamic programming. That means being able to modify the program as it is running without restarting it. Wouldn't it be nice to develop games in this way? It seems like the perfect fit, since video games are so visual, you'd want to see what your code changes look like very quickly. This talk will explore this. <a href="https://nightmod.net/">Nightmod</a> is a development environment written by Zach Oakes to modify a game in one window while it is running in another. It is based on the <a href="https://github.com/oakes/play-clj">play-clj</a> library, which he also wrote.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Game programming is a huge industry dominated by static languages with long code-compile-run cycles. Games cost millions of dollars to make, so even small improvements in developer productivity can save lots of money.</p>
<p>But further, games are hugely complex systems that are often on the cutting edge of programming. Functional programming has a lot to say about complex systems, yet there has not been a lot of functional programming in commercial games. The domain is ripe for exploration and discovery.</p>

<h3 id="talk-always-be-composingtalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#zach-tellman">Always Be Composing</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#zach-tellman">Zach Tellman's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about building composable software.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>People often boast of the composability of Clojure programs. <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure claims</a> that it &quot;allows web application to be composed of small, independent parts.&quot; <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> itself is based on composing middleware and handlers to build a web server. In fact, you can compose pieces easily with Ring, if those pieces were designed to compose with Ring. But not all libraries compose well with the Ring ecosystem. This talk asks &quot;How can we design libraries that compose well in general?&quot; A good intro to composition in Clojure is Rich Hickey's talk <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/design-composition-performance-keynote">Design, Composition, and Performance</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>I often get asked why a certain library in Clojure doesn't have an easy interface like the one in Ruby. The answer, in many cases, is that the Clojure library was designed to compose with other code, while the Ruby library was meant for programmer convenience.</p>
<p>But if I leave it at that, this answer is unsatisfactory. Behind my answer is years of experience telling me that composition beats convenience in the long run. The asker of that question does not have that experience. I would love to have a way to explain why in an analytical way.</p>
<p>If this talk even so much as opens the conversation up about the design space of composition, it would be extremely helpful. But I'm expecting more from Zach Tellman. His talk could have a profound impact similar to Rich Hickey's talks on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values">immutable values</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0">simplicity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/moocar">Anthony Marcar</a> generously agreed to do an interview about his <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#amarcar">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a>. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-anthony-marcar">background to the talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Marcar</strong>: About 4 years ago, I decided that java wasn’t cutting it for me. I needed a new language, but I wanted to be on the JVM. So Scala and Clojure were the obvious contenders. I decided to spend 3 months building an online card game in both languages to see which I liked more. Scala at first was easier to get into, whereas Clojure was thoroughly alien. But over time, In Scala, I found I was spending more time building abstract Type graphs and waiting for compiles to finish, whereas in Clojure I was having a lot of fun and moving faster. I also loved the emphasis on immutability in Clojure. After that I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Clojure is relatively new, so you don't really get many experience reports of large production systems. When you hear someone talking about Clojure who has used it maybe only hobby projects or small projects, what are the common things that strike you as untrue?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: I don’t know if &quot;untrue&quot; is the right way to put it, but things people generally haven’t thought about before embarking on larger Clojure projects are things like how do you deploy your application, how do you go about logging and monitoring? How do you protect your application from going down if downstream dependencies start timing out? And how do you grow a code base across multiple projects? There still aren’t many resources in the Clojure space to answer these kinds of questions.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Have you had experience bringing programmers who don't know Clojure onto your team? What were the challenges? What surprised you?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: Yes I have had rubyists, node.js and python people join the team. Not surprisingly the JVM was a big challenge. Things like the local maven repository, logging, and common java libraries can be hard to grasp. I was however surprised how easily everyone picked up on Clojure’s fundamentals such as immutability. I guess it’s because that’s what attracted them to the language in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Do you think Clojure is a good fit for large companies with lots of software?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: Clojure is great for large companies. I think it’s greatest asset is its focus on data structures. In big companies, this is a big deal as there are layers and layers of legacy systems, each with their own outdated data formats and protocols. Clojure's focus on data transformations and concurrency makes it perfect for working with many different services to produce the right business outcome. That, combined with the the fact that it runs on the JVM makes it perfect for large companies.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Do you have any advice for the folks out there working for big companies who want to introduce Clojure to their work?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: If you want to introduce Clojure at a large company, get ready for a very tough road ahead. Work from both the bottom and top of the organization. Try and find the engineers who are always looking at new technologies. The kind who get home and build side projects. Then infect them. At the same time, scour the organization for VPs, or SVPs who &quot;get&quot; technologists. Buy them a beer. Ask them to be a champion for you, to protect you every time a more &quot;traditional&quot; team tries to block your progress. You’ll need all the help you can get and will have to work well past your normal hours, but it’s worth it.</p>
<p>If you want to take a shortcut, build a company that does Clojure, and then get acquired by said big company ;)</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: All I would add is that working in Clojure is extremely fun. If you’re not already working in it full time, go and apply for a job somewhere where you can!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: An ice cream sandwich. Because it’s awesome. That is all.</p>

<p>Brandon Bloom generously agreed to do an interview about his <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#bbloom">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a>. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-brandon-bloom">background to the talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Bloom</strong>: From 2009 to 2011, I encountered a couple of Rich's talks and writings. Each time I would look at Clojure briefly, but it never really clicked. When ClojureScript was released, my startup was heavily using CoffeeScript, so I decided to take a more serious peek at this new alternative. I immediately fell in love with Clojure and started contributing to ClojureScript. My startup never did get a chance to use ClojureScript, but Clojure on the JVM quickly became one of my favorite tools for prototypes and experiments, and I've lately, I've used it for <em>serious business</em> with some frequency.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: You will be talking about the CircleCI frontend, written in ClojureScript and Om. Om is less than 18 months old, and yet it is used in production systems and I assume replaced their previous frontend system. Can you speak to this decision? How was it evaluated?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: I honestly can't speak to the decision to use Om. That was made before I got involved. What I can say is that CircleCI was already a big Clojure user and their front end used to be CoffeeScript based. Daniel Woelfel deserves all the credit for choosing Om and delivering a production system with it. I got involved much later.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What were some of the challenges that you faced when developing with such a new library as Om?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Om is/was still evolving. It's got bugs, misfeatures, and other problems. Luckily, I've had the luxury of regular face time with David Nolen, Om's author, out at the Kitchen Table Coders studio in Brooklyn. I think that it's important for new library producers/consumers to interact regularly. Beyond that, the design patterns aren't established yet. It's difficult to simultaneously think deep thoughts about a challenging design space such as UI code, while also building a useful UI for your product. Sometimes, you just need to hack it and you can't be afraid to dig in to the library code while you're hacking it. After that, you need to reflect on whether your solution actually makes sense: Often it doesn't!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What are some improvements to Om you would like to see?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: That's a tough question to answer constructively, since David has already picked all of the low hanging fruit that I've pointed out to him. Overall, Om is an absolute delight. That said, it's clearly a first real attempt at the React style of UI development in Clojure. Some parts of Om, like cursors, just never made much sense. Other parts feel like missed opportunities to truly capitalize on ClojureScript's strengths. At this point, my feedback could be rolled in to notes for a second attempt at this style of UI framework in Clojure.</p>
<p>David has made the very pragmatic decision to assume React.js as a long term dependency. However, once you really get in to the weeds hacking on a UI, it becomes clear, at least it did to me, that less layers is always a good thing. Overall, a virtual DOM implementation is pretty easy, although getting it to perform well is tricky. I'd really like to see a ClojureScript library that drops the React.js dependency in favor of a more direct mapping to Clojure idioms.</p>
<p>The dichotomy between primitive elements and Om components (created via om/build) has got to go. It hurts modularity and refactorability. But I also don't particularly like some users' insistence on hiccup forms for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.circleci.com/local-state-global-concerns/">&quot;no local state&quot; descriptors</a> thing should definitely be <em>the only way</em> Om operate.</p>
<p>The &quot;world in an atom&quot; model isn't quite structured enough. We need something more database-like to manage client/server synchronization. Facebook's Relay is impressive and, if you squint right, their GraphQL looks a lot like Datomic's Pull API. I know that Sean Grove has been experimenting with a DataScript-backed UI. I think that somebody needs to ship a prescriptive framework here that integrates a client-side database with the view layer.</p>
<p>I've also got extensive notes for an alternative events system.</p>
<p>Beyond that, toolability is critical. The framework needs a way to design and test an individual component in the browser. You should have to go out of your way to break that, not go out of your way to enable it.</p>

<p><strong>BB</strong>: Certainly not a burrito.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-james-macaulay">Interview with James MacAulay</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I've been writing Clojure in my spare time on-and-off for about three years.</p>
<p>In late 2011 I was on a small team developing a JavaScript MVC framework, and we had this problem of managing state in the browser over long periods of time. Our response was to let mutation happen all over the place and keep track of it all with a network of observed properties. It felt fun and empowering at first, but unfortunately it resulted in systems that were very difficult to reason about.</p>
<p>At some point I looked at the system and realized that all it needed to do was handle external events one at a time, and render some views based on those events. It was all starting to look like one big function to me...so I figured I should give a serious look at what functional programming was all about. Clojure had some really compelling answers to the questions I had, and soon I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Any suggestions for someone wanting to dive into clojure?</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: If you're coming from an Object-Oriented background, take your time just getting used to writing different kinds of functions without relying on mutable state. The more you do it, the more fun it is, and it ends up being a really valuable habit to have when writing software in any language.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before clojure?</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Mainly Ruby and JavaScript. In university it was Java more than anything else, but we were exposed to a number of other languages in smaller doses: Scheme, Prolog, C, x86 Assembly are the ones I'm most thankful for. When I first got interested in functional programming I dug into Haskell for a bit before Clojure really grabbed me.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about Zelkova which is heavily inspired by Elm. Have you done much with Elm or implemented Functional Reactive Programming in other languages?</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I first really got the Elm bug at Strange Loop 2013, where I saw Evan Czaplicki live code the Mario demo first-hand. I started playing with both Elm and Bacon.js, a JavaScript FRP library. Last summer I decided to try my hand at implementing FRP in Clojure, and figured I should read Evan's thesis to see how Elm works. I hadn't implemented any kind of FRP before, but Clojure seemed like a great language to do it in.</p>
<p>My experience with the Elm thesis was very similar to the one Eric Normand described having at around the same time – the code in the paper was just begging for a core.async implementation. I started hacking away, and learned a ton about both Elm and core.async in the process.</p>
<p>At Strange Loop 2014, I got to meet Evan and we had a really great chat about Elm and my work on porting its FRP system to Clojure and ClojureScript. He encouraged me to share my work and clarified a lot of things for me, and I've been poking away at Zelkova ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladed Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I try not to throw my laptop across the room when I get frustrated :)</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-john-hume">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-john-hume">Interview with John Hume</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: I started playing with Clojure in late 2008—the fairly early days. It was interesting to me because I'd always heard that Lisp was amazing, but I'd never spent any time with one. Since Clojure runs on the JVM and has simple Java interop, it was far more accessible to me than any other Lisp. Since it was a new language and community, there seemed to be a lot of other people going through the same learning process I was, so the mailing list was very helpful. And back then it was low-traffic enough that I could actually keep up, which hasn't been the case for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: I'd been doing Ruby full-time for a few years before getting interested in Clojure—and continued to spend most of my time working in Ruby until 2012. Previous to that I'd done Java for about 5 years. Ruby really opened my eyes to how much power and expressiveness Java had been keeping from me. But after an exciting learning period with Ruby, I'd gotten a bit bored. Clojure came into my life at just the right time!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Any suggestions for someone wanting to dive into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: That's a tough one. A background in Java and Ruby made it easy for me to deal with some of what can make Clojure difficult for newcomers: Java helped with the JVM, the API, and the ecosystem, while Ruby had already made me comfortable with strong but dynamic typing and some functional concepts. For someone with a similar background, I'd definitely recommend giving Clojure a try.</p>
<p>My advice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with tools you're comfortable with, rather than learning a tool you don't find intuitive while also learning a new language.</p></li>
<li><p>Start with a problem space you're familiar with, whether that's web, graphics, or data analysis, and find libraries that don't hide away too much magic.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the code! Lots of clojure.core and most other standard and contrib libraries are implemented in straightforward, idiomatic Clojure. Hopefully your tool of choice makes it seemless to jump into that code from your own. The only caveat with that advice is that sometimes—and it's not always obvious when this will happen—a library fn will be implemented in an unidiomatic way for reasons that aren't clear.</p></li>
<li><p>When in doubt, lean on the mailing list or IRC to find out from more experienced Clojurists whether what you're reading or writing is idiomatic or idiosyncratic code.</p></li>
<li><p>For someone with a different background, that advice might all be good, but there are probably aspects of the learning curve that I underestimate, so I'd recommend trying to find Clojurists with a similar background and getting their advice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Melanie Mitchell generously agreed to do an interview about her <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a>. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-melanie-mitchell">background to the talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: Do you program in Clojure? If not, have you heard of it? If so, how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Mitchell</strong>: No, I don’t program in Clojure, though I did write the code for my Ph.D. dissertation project in Common Lisp. I have heard of Clojure, since I’m interested in functional languages, and also some of my students have been programming in it.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: I'm no expert in AI, but I've always seen three big approaches. There are the two Peter Norvig approaches, namely the rule-based approach and the statistical approach. And then there was the approach laid out in <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</em>, which was much more about building a system that was unpredictable but whose emergent behavior was reminiscent of human intelligence. The rule-based approach has been dismissed as too brittle. And the statistical approach has had broad impact. I have to admit that I haven't heard much about the third approach in a while. Could you talk about it briefly and some of the recent advances?</p>
<p><strong>MM</strong>: You’re right -- statistical machine-learning approaches have recently seen some huge successes in applications such as object-recognition, image captioning, speech-recognition, and language translation. The major ideas behind statistical machine-learning approaches, including so-called &quot;deep networks&quot;, have been around for a while. Let's use the example of visual object-recognition. The idea is that a system is presented with many images of the concept it is supposed to learn, e.g., &quot;dog&quot;, along with many &quot;non-dog&quot; images as well, and the system essentially learns how to map images into a high-dimensional &quot;feature&quot; space in which dog images are close to one another and non-dog images are far from dog images. The &quot;statistical&quot; aspect comes in because the visual features used can be statistical in nature, and also statistical methods are used to find the best mapping.</p>
<p>So why have these methods only been so successful recently? It seems that the success is due to the fact that we now have access to huge amounts of data to train these systems, as well as very fast parallel computing methods to perform the training. These kinds of methods have become very successful in tasks such recognizing faces and specific objects (e.g., &quot;dog&quot;) in images.</p>
<p>The problem with these kinds of purely statistical methods is that, it’s hard -- maybe impossible -- to learn to recognize more abstract visual situations, such as &quot;taking a dog for a walk&quot; or &quot;training a dog&quot; or &quot;a dog show&quot;. Such situations consist of multiple objects that are related to one another in specific ways -- e.g., &quot;taking a dog for a walk&quot; typically consists of a person, a dog, and a leash, which have specific kinds of spatial and action relationships to one another. Moreover, there are lots of &quot;dog-walking&quot; situations that do not fit the prototype -- e.g., a person walking multiple dogs, a person &quot;walking a dog while riding a bike&quot;, a person running rather than walking, etc. etc. Humans are of course very good at learning to recognize abstract situations in a flexible way -- to allow &quot;slippages&quot; from a prototypical situation.</p>
<p>The general architecture described in Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies has been termed the &quot;active symbol&quot; architecture. The idea is that statistical methods interact with a network of symbolic-level structured activatable concepts. The activity of concepts in the network controls, and is controlled by, stochastic agents that bridge the gap between symbolic knowledge and statistical features. The various chapters in <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</em> describe how this architecture was developed for &quot;micro-domains&quot;, such as letter-string analogies. I'm now extending this architecture to interface with deep network approaches for the task of visual situation recognition. This is what I will describe in my talk.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Is there any background material you would suggest people read/watch before the talk?</p>
<p><strong>MM</strong>: I’ll try to make the talk as self-contained as possible, but if people are interested, they might want to read a (somewhat long) chapter from Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies, which <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/CopycatChapter.html">I’ve put online</a>. This describes the Copycat analogy-making project in some detail.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow your work online?</p>
<p><strong>MM</strong>: I have a <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/Situate.html">web page on this project</a>. This is where I will be posting papers and updates on the project.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>MM</strong>: Cream. (Because you put it on top of Java...).</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-ryan-neufeld">Interview with Ryan Neufeld</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: By my reckoning, I've been using Clojure professionally for about 2.5 years now.</p>
<p>How I got started is actually pretty interesting; I was hired by Cognitect (née Relevance) in early 2012 as a Ruby on Rails developer. Once the business shifted <em>hard</em> towards Clojure, I jumped at the first opportunity to get on with a Clojure client. My first Clojure project was with the most excellent Paul deGrandis, so it was a just a matter of letting osmosis take it's course. I haven't looked back since.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What suggestions do you have for someone getting started with clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Experiment liberally, and don't be afraid to make mistakes or &quot;do it wrong.&quot; A breadth of experience with the language and its libraries is crucial for knowing what tool to reach for when it is finally time to get down to business.</p>
<p>For those seeking to make the jump to full-time Clojure, a word of career advice: Never pass over a job opportunity because you lack on-paper experience. Every company wants to hire a Rich Hickey to work with them, but in most cases, they'd be more than happy with a bright, passionate developer such as yourself. Just give it a shot–at worst, you'll get a no, at best, you could change your life!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about Simulation Testing, is there anything like this in other languages? If yes, what advantage does the implementation in clojure have over other languages?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Indeed there is. While Simulation Testing is novel to the Clojure community, it's been around for a number of years under various names; it's sometimes called model or agent-based testing, or just plain &quot;simulation.&quot; I heard from a little bird that organizations like DARPA use the technique on nearly all of their projects.</p>
<p>There are a couple of big benefits to doing Simulation Testing in Clojure, however. First and foremost is Simulant. In addition to being a useful framework for running Simulation Tests, the way it segregates tests into phases makes tests both reproducible and amenable to new validations that you can bring to bare against old sim runs.</p>
<p>The second superpower Clojure brings to the table is Datomic. Given Datomic is a time-based fact-store, it is a nearly perfect fit for long-term, continuous-integration style simulation testing. With Datomic, very few of the validations I write involve procedural code; generally a simple Datomic query will suffice to detect abnormalities. Even better, it is trivial to query how test results have change over time.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Well, the bird is a little slow to get off the ground (Clojure start times, and all), but once she's airborne you're looking at about 2-4 Rubies (that's 10 Javas, in the imperial system).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>
