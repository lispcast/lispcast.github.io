<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Ryan Neufeld is the next interview participant. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#rneufeld">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about Simulation Testing. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-ryan-neufeld">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-ryan-neufeld">Interview with Ryan Neufeld</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: By my reckoning, I've been using Clojure professionally for about 2.5 years now.</p>
<p>How I got started is actually pretty interesting; I was hired by Cognitect (née Relevance) in early 2012 as a Ruby on Rails developer. Once the business shifted <em>hard</em> towards Clojure, I jumped at the first opportunity to get on with a Clojure client. My first Clojure project was with the most excellent Paul deGrandis, so it was a just a matter of letting osmosis take it's course. I haven't looked back since.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What suggestions do you have for someone getting started with clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Experiment liberally, and don't be afraid to make mistakes or &quot;do it wrong.&quot; A breadth of experience with the language and its libraries is crucial for knowing what tool to reach for when it is finally time to get down to business.</p>
<p>For those seeking to make the jump to full-time Clojure, a word of career advice: Never pass over a job opportunity because you lack on-paper experience. Every company wants to hire a Rich Hickey to work with them, but in most cases, they'd be more than happy with a bright, passionate developer such as yourself. Just give it a shot–at worst, you'll get a no, at best, you could change your life!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about Simulation Testing, is there anything like this in other languages? If yes, what advantage does the implementation in clojure have over other languages?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Indeed there is. While Simulation Testing is novel to the Clojure community, it's been around for a number of years under various names; it's sometimes called model or agent-based testing, or just plain &quot;simulation.&quot; I heard from a little bird that organizations like DARPA use the technique on nearly all of their projects.</p>
<p>There are a couple of big benefits to doing Simulation Testing in Clojure, however. First and foremost is Simulant. In addition to being a useful framework for running Simulation Tests, the way it segregates tests into phases makes tests both reproducible and amenable to new validations that you can bring to bare against old sim runs.</p>
<p>The second superpower Clojure brings to the table is Datomic. Given Datomic is a time-based fact-store, it is a nearly perfect fit for long-term, continuous-integration style simulation testing. With Datomic, very few of the validations I write involve procedural code; generally a simple Datomic query will suffice to detect abnormalities. Even better, it is trivial to query how test results have change over time.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Well, the bird is a little slow to get off the ground (Clojure start times, and all), but once she's airborne you're looking at about 2-4 Rubies (that's 10 Javas, in the imperial system).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-zach-tellman">Interview with Zach Tellman</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Zach</strong>: About six years, four years professionally. I started looking at Clojure around the time Tom Faulhaber (author of clojure.pprint, and some other stuff), who I worked with at the time, invited Rich Hickey to give a talk at our office. It was on chunked seqs, if I recall correctly, and way over my head. But it got me interested, and here I am.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Any suggestions for someone wanting to dive into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Zach</strong>: I've always learned by doing. I'll come up with a project, and learn what I need to know on the way. The more it forces you to learn, the better. My first project in Clojure, which I started the same week I read Stu Halloway's Clojure book, was way over-ambitious, but I learned a ton doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Zach</strong>: In school, C++ and Java. For work, C# and Java. In my own time I've poked at Erlang, OCaml, Ruby, and a few others.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Can you describe a good use-case for Clojure that you see has an advantage over another language?</p>
<p><strong>Zach</strong>: Clojure's a data-oriented language, it excels at taking data in one shape and transforming it into another. While this isn't all we do in our day-to-day software, it's an awful lot of it. Lately, though, I've been interested in the problems that fall outside of that category, which is in part what my talk is about.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Emacs or Vim or ?? Can you describe your typical workflow?</p>
<p><strong>Zach</strong>: I use Emacs, where I know about five commands, plus paredit. I don't particularly like it, but I don't dislike it enough to switch to something else.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>
