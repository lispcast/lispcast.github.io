<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Dr. Elena Machkasova teaches at the Univesity of Minnesota, Morris. She is working on a project called <a href="http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~elenam/#clojure">ClojureEd</a> to teach Clojure as a teaching language to novice programmers. Read the <a href="http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~elenam/#clojure">papers</a> to understand the background. This talk promises to be very interesting in terms of pedagogical techniques (how to teach Clojure and programming) and tooling/setup for beginners.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#fhanreich">Fumiko Hanreich's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about HoneySQL, a Clojure DSL for representing SQL queries.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>People in the Clojure community talk a lot about representing things as data. This is an approach inherited from its Lisp forebears. <a href="https://github.com/jkk/honeysql">HoneySQL</a> is a data-oriented DSL that represents SQL queries. You build up SQL statements in a structured form, not string concatenation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jkk/honeysql">HoneySQL</a> is a good example of a case where the Clojure philosophy allows for a solution to an existing problem. The problem is that SQL is designed as a human-facing language. That's fine by itself, but it is not a good language for composing pieces of a query into a larger query--the kind of things a program would do. HoneySQL provides an intermediate representation that is way more amenable to manipulation. In a way, it does the same thing for SQL as Lisp s-expressions did for code.</p>

<h3 id="talk-purely-randomtalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#gfredericks">Purely Random</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#gfredericks">Gary Fredericks' talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about a functional approach to generating random numbers.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Random number generation (RNG) is typically achieved by using mutable state. And of course, that means they're not great for parallel processing, let alone being generally harder to reason about.</p>
<p>An <em>immutable</em> random number generator returns the next random bytes <em>and</em> a new generator for the next number. A splittable random number generator adds a new function called <code>split</code>, which takes a generator and returns two new generators. It lets you guarantee that the same numbers are generated every time regardless of interleaving.</p>
<p>Haskell's <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">Quickcheck</a> uses splittable random number generators. The talk description states that Clojure's <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">test.check</a>, which is based on Quickcheck, would benefit from splittable random number generators, presumably by allowing for concurrency.</p>
<p>I found an interesting paper about an efficient implementation of <a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/183348/local_183348.pdf">Splittable RNGs</a>. Also, the <a href="http://www.dunaj.org/dunaj.math.random.api.html">dunaj-project</a> has some interesting work in this area, using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/SplittableRandom.html"><code>java.util.SplittableRandom</code></a> (Java 8) and Transducers.</p>

<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Micha Niskin</strong>: I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB63C06FAF154F047">SICP lectures from MIT</a> and was blown away by the simplicity of Lisp. At the time I was programming in Perl, C, and Java, mostly (I was actually on a programming hiatus building boats in Maine, but you know, you never just stop programming). So I started doing some things in Scheme (Racket) and I really enjoyed it. I was learning awesome new things at a rate I'd never experienced before. Then Alan recommended I try Clojure. I was initially skeptical of the syntax, but persistent collections were a real revelation and I quickly joined the cult.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Dipert</strong>: When I learned about arrays in Visual Basic 4, someone told me that some language &quot;LISP&quot; was somehow made out of arrays, which I giggled at because it sounded so silly. Later, in college, my coolest professor challenged my Java class to complete assignments in alternate JVM languages. I took the opportunity to learn some Scala, and for the final assignment, Clojure. Clojure blew my mind - what didn't immediately click was somehow very obviously something I would need to learn and would unlock more awesome things. The Clojure, and the learning, haven't stopped since then.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Last year you all released Hoplon. Everyone else was zigging toward React, while you zagged to a completely different paradigm. I can't help but see a parallel with Boot. Nearly all Clojure projects use Leiningen, and here you are zagging again. I think you've explained why already. What I want to know is the thinking that leads to two very zaggy approaches. Were the existing libraries not scratching your itches? Or do you have a deep desire to develop your own tools from scratch?</p>
<p><strong>AD</strong>: Hoplon is a packaging of a vision we have for how to write and maintain Single Page Applications (SPAs). We had been developing this vision for about two years before Hoplon's release, and were driven to see the vision through because we needed practical tools for professional use and found nothing that existed to be suitable.</p>
<p>In the first year (2012) of pre-Hoplon exploration, it became clear we needed to either find or develop a model for state that could work in a browser. Of the technologies we evaluated, we explored FRP most thoroughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaxF5RDdVRE">1</a>. We built a series of applications in ClojureScript using Flapjax <a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org/">2</a>.</p>
<p>Our experience with Flapjax informed our opinion that of the units of composition in FRP - behaviors and event streams - only behaviors are necessary for driving browser UIs. This is because UIs are views into memory/data, not into processes. For anything to appear in a UI, it must first appear in memory somewhere. We think behaviors, which are conceptually similar to cells in a spreadsheet, are the ultimate tool for coordinating change in data (NOT process) over time. We think core.async is probably the ultimate tool for coordinating process (NOT data) over time. FRP in its various formulations tries to do both, and not in a way that we find especially helpful.</p>
<p>We codified these opinions in early 2013 into Javelin <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/ClojureScript-Javelin">3</a>, a ClojureScript library for modeling data in SPA UIs. What Javelin didn't solve -- or even imply -- was how to actually display the data being modeled.</p>
<p>If a UI is really just a stylized view into the heap, then any data structure is a kind of UI. If Lisp is the ultimate way to compose and manipulate data structures, then it must also be the ultimate way to compose and manipulate UIs. This is the thinking behind the second big piece of Hoplon, &quot;the HLisp semantics&quot;, our answer to the question of display that Javelin leaves totally open. We worked on and around this concept in the 2nd year of pre-Hoplon (2013).</p>
<p>Concretely, HLisp is a set of semantics <a href="https://github.com/tailrecursion/hlisp-starter/blob/master/PROJECT.md">5</a> that map HTML markup into the Lisp evaluation model. That is, the HTML expression <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code> is identical to the ClojureScript expression <code>(ul (li &quot;one&quot;))</code>. Both evaluate to a live Node object in heap that can be passed to and returned from functions. Under HLisp, a list might be constructed like this: <code>(apply ul (map li [&quot;one&quot; &quot;two&quot; &quot;three&quot;]))</code>. Because these expressions evaluate to native browser objects, they can compose with a vast array of plugins and libraries available in the frontend ecosystem.</p>
<p>A big positive of HLisp is that HTML becomes a syntax for a subset of ClojureScript. We find this especially beneficial because it means any designer or UX expert familiar with HTML can easily contribute. We've never worked on a team that didn't include at least one designer/UX expert, and we believe this demographic is totally underserved by existing tools. Part of our vision is to empower designers to experience the same level of &quot;flow&quot; that we Lispers know comes with simple, clear models that we can infinitely extend.</p>
<p>Realizing fully HLisp pushed the limits of every build tool we tried to make it work in, because it was different than what anyone had ever wanted to do before. It was clear to us that the kind of transformation HLisp required needed to be accessible, and we began to imagine how a build system capable of these kinds of things could work. We dreamed of compiling Markdown, into HAML, into HTML, into ClojureScript, into JavaScript, reliably, simply, and accessibly.</p>
<p>We developed Boot1 to serve these needs, and shipped Hoplon atop it last year. We haven't had much reason to change Javelin, HLisp, or Hoplon over the past couple years, but we have rolled the set of ideas for improvement accumulated over a year of Boot1 use into the nascent Boot2. Today, Boot2 is capable of the Markdown -&gt; JavaScript transformation and much more. We are really happy and excited that it is drawing enthusiasm from Clojure and ClojureScript users outside of Hoplon-world.</p>
<p>To finally answer your question: It's not that we think being different or building our own tools are virtues; we're just lucky to have had a series of opportunities -- starting with our friendship -- to experience, study deeply, and attempt to solve as definitively as possible the big programming challenges we've faced.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: In terms of Boot, what were those challenges that Leiningen did not solve? And how does Boot solve them?</p>
<p><strong>AD</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leiningen does not supply a general file system watcher; every plugin must provide its own</li>
<li>Leiningen does not coordinate filesystem access between plugins; the user must be mindful of every plugin's file use and weary of filesystem contention</li>
<li>Leiningen plugins cannot easily be composed or invoked from the REPL, which requires the user to start a new JVM for every experiment</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons I would say that Leiningen plugins must all duplicate essential functionality, don't compose well, and are cumbersome to develop and experiment with.</p>
<p>Hoplon existed for a short time as a Leiningen plugin, but like all ambitious Leiningen plugins it became its own build tool and didn't compose especially well with other plugins. Once your Leiningen plugin becomes essentially its own build tool, it's not hard to imagine taking the last step.</p>
<p>This is what we did and Boot was the result; Hoplon dissolved into a half-dozen Boot &quot;tasks&quot;. Boot solves the problems we encountered in Leiningen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot tasks are &quot;stateful middlewares&quot; composed in a pipeline, similar to Ring middleware. Tasks can decide whether the tasks after them should run, the same way a Ring middleware can decide whether or not to invoke the next handler. With a reference to the next task, a task can invoke the next task once, multiple times, or not at all. With this ability, &quot;watch&quot; is no longer special, and it becomes a regular task. Library authors are empowered to write other watch-like tasks that initiate or prohibit builds depending on any condition, not just filesystem state.</li>
<li>The value passed through the pipeline of tasks represents the file system, and is called a FileSet. It is an immutable snapshot of a filesystem. If a task needs to effect a change, addition, or deletion to the filesystem, it performs an operation on the FileSet -- returning a new FileSet -- NOT directly on the filesystem as a mutation operation. After the last task returns the final FileSet, Boot synchronizes the FileSet to the target directory. Access to the value of a FileSet doesn't need to be synchronized because it is immutable and the actual filesystem is not in contention. FileSet operations are efficient because Boot uses a content-addressed, hard-link backed structural sharing scheme to minimize actual file operations.</li>
<li>A Boot task is a function, nothing more. Boot tasks can be created, tested, and composed in the REPL or in any Clojure program just like any Clojure function can. Facilitating task composition is a &quot;unit of classpath isolation&quot;, the &quot;pod&quot;, which is a Clojure runtime that can have dependencies independent of the rest of the build. So, these task functions can have dependencies independent of the project they might operate on. For instance, a task might supply typechecking using core.typed in a pod, but this doesn't imply the user know or care to add core.typed to their project's dependencies. Because tasks are functions, and because we have a unit of classpath, most builds can be orchestrated in a single JVM. Builds are easier to develop, and more efficient to run.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: This sounds great! Is there an efficient path you would recommend for switching a project from Leiningen to Boot?</p>
<p><strong>AD</strong>: The best place to go after installing is definitely <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki">the wiki</a>.</p>
<p>On the wiki there are many <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Community-Tasks">community-contributed tasks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Community-Projects">projects</a> to look at for ideas and examples. There is an active and helpful community that you can connect with on IRC (in #hoplon on freenode) and at http://hoplon.discoursehosting.net/</p>
<p>If you have an idea for a script or small program, <a href="https://lionfacelemonface.wordpress.com/2015/01/17/boot-getting-started-with-clojure-in-10-minutes/">this</a> is a very nice introductory tutorial that demonstrates making a standalone, boot-powered script that can be called from the command line.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Does Boot have dependency management? Does it work with Clojars?</p>
<p><strong>MN</strong>: Sure, Boot uses Pomegranate, the same Aether library that Leiningen uses. Boot can also use Leiningen style wagons (like the S3 private wagon, for instance). The built-in tasks include tasks to install jars in your local Maven repo and to push to remote repos like Clojars. Dependencies can be loaded dynamically at runtime, and Boot has &quot;pods&quot; in which you can load dependencies that conflict with something in the current runtime.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I've been looking at Apache Ivy a bit, it looks really interesting. Maybe it's <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/m2comparison.html">something we can use in the Clojure world</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you and Boot online? How can they help?</p>
<p><strong>MN</strong>: The <a href="http://boot-clj.com">Boot website</a> is the main entry point into the weird world. We also hang out in the #hoplon channel on Freenode IRC where we provide support for all things tailrecursion but mostly just enjoy the interesting conversations that go on in there :) Help is always welcomed, people can <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/issues">check the open issues or create an issue here</a> or on the <a href="https://waffle.io/boot-clj/boot">associated kanban board here</a>. We try to schedule RC releases weekly every Monday.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you online?</p>
<p><strong>AD</strong>: We can be followed at <a href="https://twitter.com/alandipert">https://twitter.com/alandipert</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/michaniskin">https://twitter.com/michaniskin</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>AD</strong>: We both agree that Clojure is like anchovies: it's weird, relatively unpopular, but an essential ingredient in almost anything that's good. You should only ever need a small amount to make the dreariest meals magnificent. But never tell -- nobody needs to know exactly what they're so enjoying.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Bruce Hauman was gracious enough to give me an interview. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#bhauman">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about Figwheel, the ClojureScript autoreloader. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-bruce-hauman">background for his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-bruce-hauman">Interview with Bruce Hauman</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Hauman</strong>: I was doing Rails work and I was really burnt out. I had heard of Clojure and ClojureScript through HN and I have always been a big lisp fan. My favorite programming books were the Little Schemer series, PAIP, and SICP. I rewrote the pattern matching macro in PLTScheme (now Racket) as a hygenic macro and was its maintainer for a brief time.</p>
<p>My friend Tobias Crawley (of Immutant) was using Clojure as well and speaking its praises.</p>
<p>Yeah so I was already a crazy lisp fan and the idea that I could develop front end stuff in ClojureScript absolutely captivated me, so I started with it.</p>
<p>I also have to credit Simple made Easy and Rich Hickey's other inspiring talks.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Why did you create Figwheel?</p>
<p><strong>BH</strong>: A year ago, I was doing a lot of exploring with ClojureScript and at the time the REPL really didn't work. I would work really hard to get a REPL working and that work would be rewarded with an unstable REPL that just would freeze up at the worst time, so I gave up on it.</p>
<p>My motivation to write Figwheel was all about feedback. The process of repeatedly reloading the browser and manipulating a ClojureScript program into a certain state to test/verify wether a certain code section was behaving as expected was becoming absolutely intolerable. I really don't know how front end developers put up with this.</p>
<p>So I asked myself &quot;Well what is the ideal experience here?.&quot; The answer was pretty clear: I want to see the effects of my code changes as soon as I save a file.</p>
<p>I started by doing a simple test. I reloaded whole files into the browser when they finished compiling. This brute force method worked surprisingly well. I had to think about the load time side-effects of my code more, but the feedback especially for GUI programming was absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>I look back now and realize I was really lucky. The Google Closure module system is very amenable to hot patching, this and ClojureScript's awesome incremental compilation made this process very straightforward. Lots of things could have made this much more difficult/impossible but everything was in place just waiting for me to put the pieces together.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What were some of the challenges creating Figwheel?</p>
<p><strong>BH</strong>: The hardest part initially was hooking into lein-cljsbuild to get a fast reliable after compile hook. At the time, I didn't have any experience writing Leiningen plugins and also very little time working with Clojure itself, so the going was a little rough.</p>
<p>Iterating on the plugin was very time consuming because I didn't how to tap into the running process with nREPL. I ran &quot;lein figwheel&quot; over and over again and waited for the process to boot way too many times before I decided to learn a better workflow.</p>
<p>I feel like this stuff is arcane knowledge in the Clojure world. Folks talk about REPL driven workflows but as a newcomer its tough to ferret out the actual workflows themselves. Once you get it, you get it, but before then it's kinda hard to discover.</p>
<p>The next hardest thing was hacking the Google Closure module system defined in goog/base.js to accommodate live module loading. The hooks were there but I had to do a bunch a searching to find them. It turned out that a two line hack enabled live reloading with proper downstream dependency handling. Again, I felt like I got really lucky that things were designed this way.</p>
<p>After that it was smooth sailing until I got fed up with how editing macros (or any clj file on a cljs path) caused lein-cljsbuild to do a complete project recompile. This caused all kinds of havoc. I had to fix this. I wanted macro editing to be just as responsive as editing cljs files. This took a bunch of time but I am super happy with the result. Whenever I edit a macro live and think about the downstream changes being made, I'm damn impressed by the power that ClojureScript offers modern front end developers. Code &quot;transformations&quot; that you are defining live are being applied to your running code base live in the browser!!! Dang! Think about all the design decisions that came together to make that possible. Impressive!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Anything else you'd like to share?</p>
<p><strong>BH</strong>: I am really looking forward to ClojureWest, if people see me walking by please don't hesitate to hit me up.</p>
<p>There is hopefully going to be a Figwheel Unsession that will be more interactive and more technical, if people are interested they should add their twitter handle to the <a href="https://github.com/clojurewest/clojurewest2015/wiki/Unsessions">unsession page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Christopher Small was gracious enough to agree to an interview. He's <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#csmall">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about automating a chicken coop with Clojure. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-christopher-small">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-christopher-small">Interview with Christopher Small</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Small</strong>: I actually wrote a <a href="http://www.metasoarous.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-clojure/">blog post about this</a>.</p>
<p>In short, I was evaluating languages with which to implement the machine learning engine for my startup, <a href="http://pol.is/about">pol.is</a>. After having done some tinkering with Haskell and OCaml, I’d come to love functional programming, and thought it would be fun to use a functional language for this project. At the time, I wasn’t aware of FP’s strong concurrency story, but learning of it pretty naturally led me to Clojure, which we went with for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Since using it, I’ve fallen more and more in love with it every day. To me Clojure is the best of two worlds: the elegance and power of functional programming combined with the relaxed, fun atmosphere of python or ruby.</p>
<p>I’m now thoroughly addicted.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: How did you get into raising chickens? And what led you to try automating some of the tasks involved?</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: My family raised chickens when I was growing up, so I've been around them since I was little.</p>
<p>More recently, when I moved to Seattle I lived in a housing co-op called the Ballistic Chicken Coop, so called because we took care of half a dozen chickens. The chicken run was fully enclosed, but every now and again the raccoons would find a way in and we'd loose a chicken or two. We'd patch it up, but they'd eventually find another way in. At times we'd try closing the coop door at night and opening in the morning, but that became an orchestration nightmare for the house. Also, chickens like getting up early, and we... didn't. It occurred to me that the only way to make sure they were safe -- aside from completely redoing the run, a major project -- would be to set up an automatic door for the coop. I spent some time coming up with plans and door designs, but sadly never made the time to actually build it.</p>
<p>There was this chicken there we called Black Chicken. She's one of the sweetest birds I've ever seen. She would sit on my lap and let me pet her, rolling her eyes back and clucking gently. We became BFFs. But at the BCC, when chickens stop paying rent, the get &quot;evicted&quot;. Which is to say, turned into soup. While I was there, I was able to stay the hand of death, but I knew that if I moved, I would have to take her with me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my wife and I were able to find a place very close by being vacated by a friend of ours who had a small flock she needed to leave behind. However, at the new place, the top of the run wasn't fenced in like at the BCC, so we had to lock them and let them out each night and morning.</p>
<p>As a lazy, functional programmer, this could not stand, so I finally went to work building the automatic door.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What made you choose the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/BLACK">BeagleBone Black</a>?</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: The short answer is that I already had one. The long answer is the reason I had one already.</p>
<p>The world of physical computing boards breaks down into the microcontroller and full computer camps. The former is best exemplified by the Arduino, while the Raspberry Pi is the most popular of the latter.</p>
<p>Microcontroller boards are nice because they draw a lot less power, but don't come with the creature comforts of a fully fledged operating system, meaning you're stuck writing in C or C++. There is a program called Firmata one can install on their Arduino which makes it possible to control the board remotely, but that would have required an 80 ft USB cable going out to the coop. Since I wanted to try hardware programming in Clojure, this class of boards was ruled out.</p>
<p>While the Raspberry Pi is the most popular full computer board, the BBB has some distinct advantages. The BBB has more pins, and in particular has analog input pins built in, which I needed for this project. At the time anyway, it was also more powerful and had more RAM than the existing Pi, which is a plus for Clojure/JVM programming. However, the Pi released just this Feb 2015 has upped the ante a bit, at a lower price; I'm sure there will be some tit for tat for some time here. There are a whole host of other boards out there with their ups and downs, but without getting too far in the weeds, I chose the BBB.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you online?</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: I'm on <a href="http://twitter.com/metasoarous">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://github.com/metasoarous">GitHub</a> as @metasoarous, and my blog/home page is <a href="http://metasoarous.com">metasoarous.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: Had to think about this one for a while. But I'm going to go with one of my favorite fruits: the mangosteen. It's modular, elegant, and delicious :-)</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Elango Cheran was gracious enough to agree to an interview. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#echeran">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about using Clojure in other human languages. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-elango-cheran">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-elango-cheran">Interview with Elango Cheran</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Elango Cheran</strong>: I got into Clojure on the suggestion of a friend. At that point, I had been writing scripts in Python and some Ruby. I was setting off to create a cross-platform GUI desktop program using SWT, a Java UI framework. I had recently read press about Clojure, read a few Paul Graham essays, and had seen initial Clojure attempts at work, but after that, I was more skeptical about Clojure / Lisp than interested. I was thinking of using JRuby since Ruby was the most high-level language I had used by then, and I enjoyed it, entirely outside of Rails. A good friend suggested that I try Clojure instead for its elegant memory usage (via persistent data structures) and design for concurrency. As I started writing more Clojure code, the old fears faded, and I started surpassing my own expectations. I attribute the success to Clojure gently nudging me by design towards simpler, better code. It's been great fun and learning ever since.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Your talk is about adapting Clojure to work in foreign languages with different scripts. I can imagine it's very important to someone who doesn't speak English, but you probably have more insights into it. Can you speak to the difficulties someone might have with programming if they don't read/write English?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: Certainly, a lot of the tech world operates and communicates in English. I can explain the difficulties in 2 ways. First, if you can't read/write English, and want to learn programming, then you're limited to whatever resources exist in your mother tongue. From what I've seen for the Thamil language in my visits to India, even non-English resources rely on English eventually. Coining new words in another language to translate new English terms, in a fast-changing field like technology, is challenging enough. But if you want to teach coding, you have to revert to English for the source code examples regardless.</p>
<p>The other way of looking at it is from a native English speaker perspective: how old were we when we learned programming for the first time, and how hard was that? How old were we by the time we were fluent in a second language -- and fluent enough to use a computer and write code in it? I would bet that for many English speakers, programming fluency came first, and that would make sense to me. Computers and programming are tricky enough without the overhead of filtering the ideas through a second human language.</p>
<p>Currently, non-native speakers of English who learn technology are eventually bottlenecked by their ability to learn English, and learning English isn't uniformly accessible, either. Being able to write code in their first language could open up new doors, and I also think that Clojure currently would make for the easiest path to getting there.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: You mention that Clojure is well-suited to adapting to another human language. Why is that so?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: The things that make Clojure great for adapting to another human language are some of what make Clojure great as a programming language to begin with. Specific to another human language, the simplicity in the syntax is helpful in that there are less terms to translate, and the regularity of the syntax makes it easier as a beginner to wrap your head around. And more importantly, being able to extend the language without having to edit and re-compile the compiler is empowering. However, I wouldn't make any linguistic arguments in this regard -- 80+% of languages' sentence word order are either Subject-Verb-Object (e.g. English, Chinese) or Subject-Object-Verb (e.g. Thamil, Japanese), but Lisp puts the function (verb) at the beginning. Clojure targets popular runtimes (especially JVM and JavaScript), and the Clojure compiler and its target runtimes all support Unicode, which is the universal character set to represent the text of any language.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is the most interesting thing you have done with clj-thamil?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: I've written functions to implement various, basic Thamil language processing steps, like splitting a string into a seq of Thamil letters or phonemes, alphabetical sorting of strings, basic suffix-adding rules, and transliteration/character set conversions. Among other things, I've used clj-thamil along with Enlive to convert the Thamil text in an XHTML doc from a pre-Unicode character set to Unicode. I have ideas for wider-appeal applied uses in the future.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Are people writing Clojure in Thamil?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: It's just me at the moment, but I hope that improves! The simplicity of Clojure has made something that has been viewed up until now as tricky and largely unimplemented, like lexicographic Thamil text sorting, into 30 lines of Clojure. And Clojure targets Java (JVM) and JavaScript. Clojure's benefits are tremendous and speak for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: How can people help? What would be most helpful for you?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: The biggest help in terms of translating Clojure would be to figure out how to iron out a few details: how to get the reader to understand the translation for ns (or require, use, etc.), how to support translated literals (e.g. true, false, :else, numerals), and get the underlying JavaScript compiler to successfully run optimizations when identifiers are non-English. In terms of education, if we could modify clojail (used in tryclj.com) to use a JavaScript console widget that supports Unicode characters, it would provide an immediate way to experience Clojure in the language of your choice. After that, if we could translate turtle-based teaching languages, we can provide a platform for kids to learn programming in their own language.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it would be great to get help in refactoring and extending this project for other languages. Although each language has its own unique characteristics, many languages will share solutions, even in ways we don't necessarily expect.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you online?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: I'm <a href="https://github.com/echeran">@echeran</a> on Github, <a href="http://google.com/+ElangoCheran">+ElangoCheran</a> on Google Plus, and my blog is at <a href="http://www.elangocheran.com/blog">www.elangocheran.com/blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>EC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, it would be Sambar, a South Indian curry. It's tasty, has a lot of different good-for-you ingredients, it goes well with a lot of things, and I can eat it all day.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-elena-machkasova">Interview with Elena Machkasova</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you first learn Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: One of my students mentioned Clojure to me in 2009. It sounded really cool, so I included it in a class on functional programming for concurrency and was learning it partly in the summer before the course, and partly as the class was progressing.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What other languages are good for beginners or do you think clojure is the best?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: To alleviate possible confusion: I don't actually teach Clojure in a beginner-level class because there are currently no tools that would make this experience smooth for new students. I've taught Clojure as a part of a couple of upper-level courses where syntax isn't that much of an issue and students are experienced enough to deal with debugging in Clojure.</p>
<p>Beginner CS students need to focus on concepts, develop problem solving techniques, and learn to think in an abstract, modular, data-driven way. A solution needs to be developed as a series of short, clearly defined functions). A language that supports this process without getting students distracted by unnecessary details or unpredictable behavior would be a reasonable choice. Lisp languages, including Clojure, fit into this category. We currently use Racket ( a language in the Lisp family). Python is another appropriate first language. Statically typed languages, especially object-oriented ones (Java, C++), are too complex for beginners. Languages with complex interactions with memory or their environment (C, Javascript) are not a good choice either.</p>
<p>Since I haven't yet tried teaching a CS1 class with Clojure, I cannot say whether Clojure is &quot;the best&quot; (or even a reasonable) choice for beginners, but it certainly looks promising, assuming that it is made more beginner-friendly in terms of error messages and IDEs.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What types of applications do you like to use to teach your students? (i.e., a web app, console app, todo list, recipe list etc)</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: So far I mostly taught Clojure at upper level and we were mostly looking into concurrency. A beginner level class is focusing on concepts, but it has to have material that students are interested in as a small project part of the course. Possibilities include data processing and interactions with graphical libraries (animation, data visualization, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What clojure libraries do you like to use when teaching clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: We've been looking into incorporating Quil, especially the functional mode. I've also been looking into reducers for upper level courses. Expectations is a nice testing library, definitely worth including in any level course that uses Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Why would a Mars Rover would be better programmed in clojure be better than language <em>_</em> ?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: Immutable data -&gt; less possibility for error. Also, easy (i.e. less error-prone) approaches to concurrency would make large data processing fast and reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Fumiko Hanreich is the next interview participant. She is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#fhanreich">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about using the HoneySQL library for Clojure. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-fumiko-hanreich">background to her talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-fumiko-hanreich">Interview with Fumiko Hanreich</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Fumiko</strong>: In January 2012, my then-former-company asked me to take an online Clojure course. They asked me to spend about 5 hours a week for the course (and my twins were barely 16 month olds then), and I thought it was doable and I said yes. The reality was that I spent way more than 5 hours a week. Just reading and “understanding” reading assignments took a lot of time before starting an assignment. Clojure was my first Functional Programming language. Then the company sent me to Cascalog training offered prior to 2012 Clojure/West, which was my very first Clojure conference. I rejoined the company in summer. A few months later, I started coding in Clojure (for production). Very steep learning curve, yet I fell in love with the language immediately. That’s how :)</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What other languages have you done?</p>
<p><strong>Fumiko</strong>: My very first language was C++ followed by Java at college. From the get-go, everything was OOP (and I believed that was the best thing). I have done quite a few other languages such as Visual Basic, groovy, Flex / ActionScript 3.0, php, ColdFusion, JavaScript, etc. To me, it was easy to adapt to a new language except for Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Nolq</strong>: Your talk is about SQL and Clojure, how did you decide on HoneySQL?</p>
<p><strong>Fumiko</strong>: Very good question. I knew someone was going to ask thist :) To tell you the truth, I did not decide it myself. Our architect, Sean (<a href="http://twitter.com/seancorfield">@seancorfield</a>), and Justin (<a href="http://twitter.com/jkkramer">@jkkramer</a>), author of honeysql, spoke at 2012 Clojure conj. After that, it was recommended to me to use for the project I was assigned. I am extremely grateful that honeysql was already there when I needed it. It had everything I needed and made my life much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What editor(s) do you use and what is your tooling like?</p>
<p><strong>Fumiko</strong>: Emacs + paredit and Light Table. I still go back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: If Clojure was a food, what do you think it would be?</p>
<p><strong>Fumiko</strong>: This is an easy question. Quinoa and arugula or kale salad with lemon juice and splash of grounded ginger. Because that’s what I love and am excited to have every single day! It can also be any vegetables or fruits like mango, for example. Simply put, anything I love represents Clojure :)</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-gary-fredericks">Interview with Gary Fredericks</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I started using Clojure in 2009 at my first full-time software job. The person I reported to was interested in experimenting with new languages.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I learned Clojure in parallel with Ruby, Erlang, and Scala; prior to that I had only programmed as a hobby (TI-BASIC and JavaScript, both due to platform monopoly), for undergrad CS classes (Java), and for a couple minor jobs (both with C++).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What editor do you use and what is a typical workflow?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I use emacs with cider, making heavy use of the repl and in-buffer evaluation (especially dedicated scratch files for more serious efforts). I also try to invest in improving my clojure environment via my leiningen profiles and a repl utilities library.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Can you describe a good use-case for Clojure that you see has an advantage over another language?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I think Clojure has a pretty general-purpose emphasis. The result is if you buy its value proposition you'll want to use it for a broad range of things, and if you don't you'll probably not want to use it for anything, as the cost of using a less popular language will be too high.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ time echo &#39;(System/exit 0)&#39; | java -jar clojure-1.6.0.jar
Clojure 1.6.0 user=&gt;
real 0m0.928s user 0m1.431s sys 0m0.053s</code></pre>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>
