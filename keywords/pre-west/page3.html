<p>Nathan Sorenson is the next interview participant. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#nsorenson">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about DSLs.

<h3 id="interview-with-nathan-sorenson">Interview with Nathan Sorenson</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>: I've been using Clojure for 6 years. I got into the language during grad school: the libraries I needed to use for my master's research were all on the JVM, but I was becoming frustrated with the time it took to turn my ideas into experiments in code. I found Clojure and Incanter, and the REPL-based interactive workflow I experienced was incredible. There's no way I'd have been able to spend so much time exploring my problem space without Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>: Mostly Java and C++.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about DSLs, what other language have you used in the past if any to write DSLs?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>: It's often nice to write DSLs in typed FP languages. A DSL's syntax is a quintessential example of an &quot;algebraic data type,&quot; and ADTs combined with pattern matching will make it easy to interpret your syntax correctly. Haskell has some particularly useful features: the &quot;deriving&quot; mechanism, for example, gives you traversal operations for your syntax for free. Haskell also has type classes that enable an interesting style of specification called &quot;tagless final.&quot; This approach lets you sidestep the typical interpretation overhead and compile your DSL as though it were a first-class member of the host language.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What advice would you give a new programmer to Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>: I came from an imperative, object-oriented mindset and had to do a great deal of un-learning before I could grok the basics of functional programming. I personally found classic Scheme books like The Little Schemer and SICP helpful in this journey. However, everyone learns differently based on where they are coming from, so it's important not to get frustrated if you don't find someone's advice, book recommendations, or metaphors useful!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>: Lots of people get distracted quibbling about the difference between European REPLs and African REPLs but that's the wrong idea. The trick is to decomplect the question into three simpler ones: what are the average airspeeds of the Starling, the Kestrel, and the Identity bird?</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Priyatam Mudivarti was gracious enough to agree to an interview. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#pmudivarti">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about building layout grid systems using Garden in Clojure. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-priyatam-mudivarti">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-priyatam-mudivarti">Interview with Priyatam Mudivarti</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Priyatam Mudivarti</strong>: I read Chris Granger’s essay on LightTable in the fall of 2012. I remember that day: I got a new gig in Boston and my first task was to re-architect the ui stack using “Java” and “Responsive Design”. Rewriting apps in big companies meant migrating enterprise libraries and tag soups from the server to client, and most of that failed flat on your face. I had little control over the frontend, let alone design. While I was going through this—a block of no creativity—Granger’s prototypes showed an open canvas filled with code, floating around, their results shown inline, blurring the difference between an editor and a browser.</p>
<p>I was blown away.</p>
<p>What followed were his blogs, Paul Graham’s essays, Rich Hickey’s videos and other lispers blogging about enlightenment and such, but none of that made any sense. How can programming give you enlightenment? I believed in literature! Keep reading, I told myself, learn this language and it will change the way you think. The best writers, I believe, change the way you think of the world. Naturally, I am seduced by the same possibility with a programming language.</p>
<p>So I quit my job in the summer of 2013 to write my novel and teach myself Clojure and Clojurescript. I went to Clojureconj the same year and met Chris, and heard Alan Dipert, Stu, David Nolen, Rich Hickey and some of the best clojure hackers speak. After the talks I felt like one of the dumbest programmers in the room. And the more I learned about Clojure the less I knew about programming. It was an odd, beautiful feeling, something that made me a twelve-year old again.</p>
<p>I knew right away it was time to go into the rabbit hole.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where does your interest in grids come from?</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: Typography and Typesetting found in Fiction &amp; Literary Magazines (print). Often I found their layouts and typography superior to that on the web, and I always wondered why their websites suck.</p>
<p>When I spoke at ClojureWest 2014, I did a demo of a poetry app written in five languages. It was a great learning experience, but I also knew that the app wouldn’t scale and was a ticking bomb. Worse, my css was entangled in two DOMs: a virtual Dom and a real Dom, and events to change styles were bound and mounted on some lifecycle protocols of Om. One of my goals was to typeset poems and pages declaratively based on the content, and dynamically change their styles when their related ‘components' mounted. I didn’t know how to separate these concerns.</p>
<p>That led to me take a break from coding to deep dive into learning Typography. Typesetting has been around for centuries, after all. Now, design is not my core skill—I have worked in agencies and interacted with designers to understand their process. I went to TypoConf in SF and was surprised to see three hundred typographers—who don’t code css—talk about Kerning and typeface design. Met a typographer (who is now a good friend) and collaborated with him on several hobby projects to understand his process. At Sumner Stone’s workshop in SF, I saw one of the world’s oldest and most respected Typographer speak about Typography.</p>
<p>What followed was a natural discovery of Grids: a visual communication framework for graphic designers and typographers. I bought half a dozen books, downloaded and worked through a <a href="https://github.com/priyatam/thinking-grids">several grid libraries</a> in Sass and Less and began to get a sense of how web designers think. Most confirmed to the traditional Grid theory within the limited syntax available in CSS.</p>
<p>I was convinced that Garden and Clojurescript had more power to express grids (and beyond) more fluidly, and dynamically, over CSS.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is Garden?</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: Garden expresses CSS as associative data structures, the same way Hiccup expresses HTML. Vectors are used for selectors, and maps are used for declarations. They can be nested. CSS rules are simply vectors wrapping the nested vectors and maps.</p>
<p>Vectors can be passed around as data, composed through functions, and have the full power of Clojure/Clojurescript to express and organize stylesheets.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Garden compiles to CSS, how does it have more power?</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: Joel Holdbrooks wrote Garden in Clojurescript, a real programming language, and in order to understand the power of Garden let us revisit the notion of abstractions in CSS.</p>
<p>Abstraction is at the center of most work in Computer Science and User Interface Design. It encompasses finding the right interface for a system as well as finding an effective design for implementing a system. CSS is arguably a simple language. It packs power by abstracting the entire stylesheet in concise, declarative syntax of rules.</p>
<p>However, over the years websites and apps have grown in complexity and pre-processors have proven that programming constructs like variables, mixins, and ‘pseudo’ functions can help designers organize code and structure their patterns. In order to facilitate a two-way communication with Dom, designers have also started using jQuery—a good example of what happens when you provide new abstractions to interact with a page. The proliferation of frontend frameworks have paralyzed even the best designers because it’s impossible to work within the same abstraction in isolation with the frontend team.</p>
<p>What remains is a spaghetti of Sass, client and serverside Markup, jQuery, and a dozen Javascript libraries and build tools. Designers are no longer in control of the page, and that’s a shame.</p>
<p>It is time we bring back that control with new abstractions. Garden is just Clojurescript— you don’t even need to learn the whole language. It provides a uniform syntax to express HTML, CSS, and Javascript from a designer’s point of view. It has namespaces to modularize styles, first-class functions, and sound data structures to organize them. It works on the server and client and can generate static css files. It has the potential to go beyond pre-processors and express designs in new creative ways. I’m more excited of this possibility than anything else, because if done right, it is possible to talk to print designers and graphic designers—in a language they understand.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/facjure/mesh">Garden library</a> and plan to show a few examples in my talk at ClojureWest. I have a long way to go, but it’s a start.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is the most common mistake programmers can fix with their typography?</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: Vary contrast on the page by using the CSS font-xx and text-xx properties. For instance, take a plain html of your blog and practice typesetting header, body copy, certain subheadings, blockquotes, menu, and code blocks using different font weights and sizes and variants. See what happens. And please—don’t stick a default Helvetica into your body. Use a professional font, preferably in pairs. If in doubt, buy a print magazine. Steal.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What resources would you point someone to to learn typography, grid layouts, and CSS?</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: There are many resources.</p>
<p>My favorite typography book is Mathew Butterick’s <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a>; he’s a typeface designer and a lisp hacker. Ellen Lupton’s <a href="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/">Thinking with Type</a> is an excellent book that covers both the history and an in-depth discussion on designing with Type. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grid-Systems-Graphic-Design-Communication/dp/3721201450">Grid Systems in Graphic Design</a> is considered a classic.</p>
<p>There are plenty of CSS books: <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118008189.html">HTML5 &amp; CSS</a>, <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers">CSS3 for web designers</a>, and anything written by Chris Coyler at <a href="http://csstricks.com/">csstricks.com</a>.</p>
<p>When I spoke at Clojure/West last year I did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78akckfpvnQ">a demo</a>.</p>
<p>Shameless plug—I’m writing a book on UI Design from a self-taught designer and programmer's perspective, and plan to publish it this summer.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you online?</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: My <a href="http://www.priyatam.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/priyatam">twitter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: Clojure would be an Herb you would combine with others and drink, like good Oolong tea.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Tom Faulhaber is the next interview participant. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#tfaulhaber">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about using Clojure to create Excel spreadsheets. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-tom-faulhaber">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-tom-faulhaber">Interview with Tom Faulhaber</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Rich Hickey did a talk called “Clojure for Lisp Programmers.” I bookmarked that talk but avoided it because I was scared of it. The idea seemed too interesting and I was afraid I’d get sucked in.</p>
<p>But over Thanksgiving weekend 2009, I had some time and I watched the video. I <em>was</em> sucked in and I’ve been an active member of the Clojure community ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What other languages did you do before?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I’ve done them all. I’m a creature of the dark ages so I started with Basic, Cobol, Fortran and early Lisps. In the early part of my career, I worked on operating systems, data bases, and networking. This was all C and later C++. Nowadays, I do primarily Clojure and R along with some Python and Scala. One of the things I’ve learned is that there’s no silver bullet language: a clear understanding of of goals and good communication trump language choice every time.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What do you like best about Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I love Clojure, the language, but what I like even better is Clojure, the community. From the very beginning, Rich has worked hard to make sure it was a community of people that was positive towards each other.</p>
<p>Since then, more people have taken up the mantle of making Clojure more inclusive with initiatives like ClojureBridge and diversity scholarships. In addition to the folks using their own energy to make this happen, I have been very happy with the overall supportive tone in the community with respect to these efforts.</p>
<p>Like all tech communities, we clearly have a long way to go, but it’s hard not to be pleased that the community is receptive to these goals and always looking for ways to be better.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What advice do you give new clojure developers?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: This would be my advice for anyone learning a new language: human or computer. Take the language on its own terms and don’t try to enforce your own previous assumptions on it. For example, in Spanish the adjective usually comes after the noun. This causes a reaction in English speakers, who often think that Spanish gets it “wrong.” That’s not a productive approach to embracing the language (and, in fact, one reason to learn foreign languages is to experience those differences and thereby gain perspective).</p>
<p>In the case of Clojure, parenthesis, prefix notation, and lack of built-in typing come to the top of that list. When you’re learning Clojure, try really hard not to have negative opinions about these things. Accept what the experienced folks say is “best.” Later when you’re more familiar with the language, you’ll probably agree with the experts. But even if you don’t, it won’t be because you let yourself be blinded by where you came from.</p>
<p>Having said all that: <em>Do</em> use paredit. It makes dealing with the parentheses fade into the background and is available in most dev environments now.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What does your tooling look like? emacs or vim or ?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I’m an emacs user from way back. I’ve been very thankful for the work that Bozhidar Batsov, Phil Hagelberg and others have done over the years to make the Emacs Clojure environment so nice.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about creating spreadsheets in Excel, have you spent alot of time creating spreadsheets in other languages? what benefits do you get over using clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Yeah, a friend told me recently that I’ve been obsessed with Excel for a long time. I have used Excel natively and Excel from .Net (mostly through IronPython) to create live dashboards of systems and businesses in action without the overhead of building a website or buying an expensive tool.</p>
<p>I want to be able to use Excel for the things it’s good at and use Clojure for the things it’s good at. It turns out that they can go really well together.</p>
<p>For more on that, you’ll have to come to my talk which will involve live coding in <em>both</em> Clojure and Excel!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How would you use clojure to defeat the Kobayashi Maru ?</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: That’s easy - use destructuring to get the Kobayashi Maru out of the neutral zone without entering it myself:</p>
<pre><code>(defn rescue-kobayashi-maru
  [neutral-zone]
  (let [{:keys [kobayashi-maru]} neutral-zone]
    kobayashi-maru))</code></pre>
<p>Back in the real world, I’ve found that Clojure’s capabilities to handle super-complex deeply nested data structures gets me out of scrapes that users of other languages thought were almost impossible to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-tyler-tallman">Interview with Tyler Tallman</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: I had read much about it before, but Stephan Richter's demonstration of Clojure on app engine led me to binge listen to every Rich Hickey talk I could find. He had me at &quot;epochal time model&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: C++ python and a bit of php</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What advice do you have for beginner Clojure programmers?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Read lots of other peoples code and take the time to make at least one design as simple as you possibly can.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is your tooling like? emacs or vim or ?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: I started on vim moved to emacs for it's clojure support and now mostly use Cursive.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: You mention React in your talk description, are you using it in ClojureScript? What flavor of React are you using? (ie Om, Reagent, etc)</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: We use a modified version of Quiescent. I think all the React from Clojure work will eventually grow together into a set of functions and a common macro used to generate the react class directly.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How would you use Clojure to defeat the kobayashi maru?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Persistent data structures of course</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-yoko-harada">Interview with Yoko Harada</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: My experience is quite sparse, but I've been using Clojure for about 4 years. Since I'm a JVM language lover, I had a great interest in Clojure, which was very different from other JVM languages. I started ClojureScript integrating Ruby gem at first.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: Mostly, Java and Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What are your thoughts on Clojure being a first language or do you think its more suited to someone who has some experience in programming?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: It depends. Thinking of the time I was a student, for some folks, lisp was the first language and did well using Lisp. For many people, Clojure coding is not similar to how they think. For example, in OOP, &quot;I have a cup of soup. let's add some spice&quot;, in Lisp, &quot;Let's add something and other stuff, what about soup and spice.&quot; Sometime, the latter is productive in coding while sometime, the former is. I admit OOP is natural for vast majority. But, at the same time, I don't think programming experience will help to think like Lisp.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What kinds of help do you need for ClojureBridge?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>spread the word</li>
<li>plan to organize ClojureBridge</li>
<li>have experiences of organizing, TAing, and others of ClojureBridge</li>
<li>involve yourself in ClojureBridge curriculum improvements based on the experience</li>
<li>become a ClojureBridge board member</li>
<li>become a ClojureBridge mentor and help people who firstly organize ClojureBridge</li>
<li>donate and support ClojureBridge financially. The workshop needs venue, some food and. sometime, coaches/TAs' travel expense</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is your favorite clojure library?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: Hoplon</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jmacaulay">James MacAulay's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about Zelkova, his Functional Reactive Programming library.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Zelkova is a Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) library inspired by the <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> FRP model. FRP is a model for building composable &quot;signals&quot; that maintain the state of the system over time. The talk promises to show us how to use it with Om to create interactive applications.</p>
<p>There are many resources out there, but I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-nTU3Wy26I">this talk about Functional Reactive Programming in Elm</a> by Elm's creator Evan Czaplicki. It shows the possibilities of FRP. <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf">His thesis</a>, which describes the basic constructs of Elm, is <em>surprisingly</em> approachable. I recommend that highly. Also, James MacAulay himself did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH3M2nweKJ0">Papers We Love presentation</a> about it, which is worth watching.</p>

<h3 id="talk-design-and-prototype-a-language-in-clojuretalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jadkisson">Design and Prototype a Language in Clojure</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jadkisson">Jeanine Adkisson's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about designing and prototyping a language using Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Lisps have been used for a long time to prototype other languages. Scheme was designed and used for just that purpose. The most popular books on compiler design often start with Lex and Yacc, which are just really old tools built when memory was so restricted you had to do your parsing in stages. <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">Instaparse</a> is way better for quickly exploring syntax. And since lambda calculus (which Clojure is based on) is computationally complete, you're in good hands exploring the entire range of computational semantics.</p>
<p>However, these are just generalities. Jeanine Adkisson will likely bring wit and depth to the talk, as she did in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQkIWWTygio">her Clojure/conj talk</a>. She's a language designer, so she's got plenty of experience to draw from.</p>
<p>As an interesting background to language prototyping in Clojure, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHubfS8E--o">Bodil Stokke talking about her language Bodol</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jhume">John Hume's talk</a> at Clojure/West is about Clojure internals.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>You can get a lot done in Clojure without understanding much about its internals. But when your code doesn't do what you expect, whether in terms of behavior or performance, it can be extremely useful to dig into the underlying Java code.</p>
<p>John's presentation will walk the audience through some of that code by following a simple map-literal expression through Clojure's reader and analyzer, particularly focusing on code generation in <code>clojure.lang.Compiler</code>, and then onto runtime evaluation. The hope is that you'll come out of the talk better able to analyze what's really happening in your own Clojure code.</p>

<h3 id="talk-clojure-parallelism-beyond-futurestalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#lbarrett">Clojure Parallelism: Beyond Futures</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#lbarrett">Leon Barrett's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about parallelism in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure is well known for its parallel programming super powers. Immutable data structures, concurrency primitives, and a few convenient constructs like <code>future</code> and <code>pmap</code> have been there since the beginning. But what's even cooler is how people have been able to build on the strong foundation Clojure established to create new parallel abstractions. Leon Barrett will talk about some of these. The description mentions reducers, tesser, and claypoole.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/45561411">Rich Hickey gave a talk about reducers</a> back in 2012, focusing on the ideas and abstractions they are based on. A more practical <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-reducers">talk was given by Renzo Borgatti</a> at Strange Loop 2013. Kyle Kingsbury <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5738-keynote-by-kyle-kingsbury">gave a talk about <em>tesser</em></a>, a library which extends Clojure's parallel abstractions to execute in a <em>distributed</em> manner. And Leon Barrett himself wrote a recent <a href="http://eng.climate.com/2014/02/25/claypoole-threadpool-tools-for-clojure/">blog post about Claypoole</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#lvanderhart">Luke Vanderhart's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about the ReactJS Landscape.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>ReactJS appeared from <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html">Facebook</a> last year in silence and without fanfare (from my view anyways!) but recent months has had an explosion on the web frameworks space, in particular in Clojure because of the common thread of immutablility running through the core concepts.</p>
<p>Since Facebook announced it in June, we have seen several incarnations of React in Clojure: <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om</a>, <a href="https://github.com/levand/quiescent">Quiescent</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent">Reagent</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>ReactJS is the View in MVC apps and is a declarative library for describing a user interface, it can figure out what parts of the application to redraw on an update. With the popularity of single page applciations this is key to making a fast and responsive user interface.</p>
