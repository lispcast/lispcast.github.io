<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Tyler Tallman is the next interview participant. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#ttallman">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about Clojure to do real-time communication in the healthcare industry. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-tyler-tallman">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-tyler-tallman">Interview with Tyler Tallman</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: I had read much about it before, but Stephan Richter's demonstration of Clojure on app engine led me to binge listen to every Rich Hickey talk I could find. He had me at &quot;epochal time model&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: C++ python and a bit of php</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What advice do you have for beginner Clojure programmers?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Read lots of other peoples code and take the time to make at least one design as simple as you possibly can.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is your tooling like? emacs or vim or ?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: I started on vim moved to emacs for it's clojure support and now mostly use Cursive.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: You mention React in your talk description, are you using it in ClojureScript? What flavor of React are you using? (ie Om, Reagent, etc)</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: We use a modified version of Quiescent. I think all the React from Clojure work will eventually grow together into a set of functions and a common macro used to generate the react class directly.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How would you use Clojure to defeat the kobayashi maru?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Persistent data structures of course</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-yoko-harada">Interview with Yoko Harada</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: My experience is quite sparse, but I've been using Clojure for about 4 years. Since I'm a JVM language lover, I had a great interest in Clojure, which was very different from other JVM languages. I started ClojureScript integrating Ruby gem at first.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: Mostly, Java and Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What are your thoughts on Clojure being a first language or do you think its more suited to someone who has some experience in programming?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: It depends. Thinking of the time I was a student, for some folks, lisp was the first language and did well using Lisp. For many people, Clojure coding is not similar to how they think. For example, in OOP, &quot;I have a cup of soup. let's add some spice&quot;, in Lisp, &quot;Let's add something and other stuff, what about soup and spice.&quot; Sometime, the latter is productive in coding while sometime, the former is. I admit OOP is natural for vast majority. But, at the same time, I don't think programming experience will help to think like Lisp.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What kinds of help do you need for ClojureBridge?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>spread the word</li>
<li>plan to organize ClojureBridge</li>
<li>have experiences of organizing, TAing, and others of ClojureBridge</li>
<li>involve yourself in ClojureBridge curriculum improvements based on the experience</li>
<li>become a ClojureBridge board member</li>
<li>become a ClojureBridge mentor and help people who firstly organize ClojureBridge</li>
<li>donate and support ClojureBridge financially. The workshop needs venue, some food and. sometime, coaches/TAs' travel expense</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is your favorite clojure library?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: Hoplon</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jmacaulay">James MacAulay's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about Zelkova, his Functional Reactive Programming library.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Zelkova is a Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) library inspired by the <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> FRP model. FRP is a model for building composable &quot;signals&quot; that maintain the state of the system over time. The talk promises to show us how to use it with Om to create interactive applications.</p>
<p>There are many resources out there, but I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-nTU3Wy26I">this talk about Functional Reactive Programming in Elm</a> by Elm's creator Evan Czaplicki. It shows the possibilities of FRP. <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf">His thesis</a>, which describes the basic constructs of Elm, is <em>surprisingly</em> approachable. I recommend that highly. Also, James MacAulay himself did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH3M2nweKJ0">Papers We Love presentation</a> about it, which is worth watching.</p>

<h3 id="talk-design-and-prototype-a-language-in-clojuretalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jadkisson">Design and Prototype a Language in Clojure</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jadkisson">Jeanine Adkisson's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about designing and prototyping a language using Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Lisps have been used for a long time to prototype other languages. Scheme was designed and used for just that purpose. The most popular books on compiler design often start with Lex and Yacc, which are just really old tools built when memory was so restricted you had to do your parsing in stages. <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">Instaparse</a> is way better for quickly exploring syntax. And since lambda calculus (which Clojure is based on) is computationally complete, you're in good hands exploring the entire range of computational semantics.</p>
<p>However, these are just generalities. Jeanine Adkisson will likely bring wit and depth to the talk, as she did in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQkIWWTygio">her Clojure/conj talk</a>. She's a language designer, so she's got plenty of experience to draw from.</p>
<p>As an interesting background to language prototyping in Clojure, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHubfS8E--o">Bodil Stokke talking about her language Bodol</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#jhume">John Hume's talk</a> at Clojure/West is about Clojure internals.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>You can get a lot done in Clojure without understanding much about its internals. But when your code doesn't do what you expect, whether in terms of behavior or performance, it can be extremely useful to dig into the underlying Java code.</p>
<p>John's presentation will walk the audience through some of that code by following a simple map-literal expression through Clojure's reader and analyzer, particularly focusing on code generation in <code>clojure.lang.Compiler</code>, and then onto runtime evaluation. The hope is that you'll come out of the talk better able to analyze what's really happening in your own Clojure code.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#lbarrett">Leon Barrett's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about parallelism in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure is well known for its parallel programming super powers. Immutable data structures, concurrency primitives, and a few convenient constructs like <code>future</code> and <code>pmap</code> have been there since the beginning. But what's even cooler is how people have been able to build on the strong foundation Clojure established to create new parallel abstractions. Leon Barrett will talk about some of these. The description mentions reducers, tesser, and claypoole.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/45561411">Rich Hickey gave a talk about reducers</a> back in 2012, focusing on the ideas and abstractions they are based on. A more practical <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-reducers">talk was given by Renzo Borgatti</a> at Strange Loop 2013. Kyle Kingsbury <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5738-keynote-by-kyle-kingsbury">gave a talk about <em>tesser</em></a>, a library which extends Clojure's parallel abstractions to execute in a <em>distributed</em> manner. And Leon Barrett himself wrote a recent <a href="http://eng.climate.com/2014/02/25/claypoole-threadpool-tools-for-clojure/">blog post about Claypoole</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#lvanderhart">Luke Vanderhart's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about the ReactJS Landscape.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>ReactJS appeared from <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html">Facebook</a> last year in silence and without fanfare (from my view anyways!) but recent months has had an explosion on the web frameworks space, in particular in Clojure because of the common thread of immutablility running through the core concepts.</p>
<p>Since Facebook announced it in June, we have seen several incarnations of React in Clojure: <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om</a>, <a href="https://github.com/levand/quiescent">Quiescent</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent">Reagent</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>ReactJS is the View in MVC apps and is a declarative library for describing a user interface, it can figure out what parts of the application to redraw on an update. With the popularity of single page applciations this is key to making a fast and responsive user interface.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers">Melanie Mitchell's keynote</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about building computer systems that recognize visual situations.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Melanie Mitchell is a researcher in Artificial Intelligence, complex systems, and machine learning. She did her PhD with Douglas Hofstadter, which resulted in Copycat, which was featured prominently in Hofstadter's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fluid-Concepts-And-Creative-Analogies/dp/0465024750?tag=lisp0b-20">Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</a>. Perhaps coincidentally, Copycat was <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/how-to-get-copycat.html">written in Lisp</a>. The branch of Artificial Intelligence that she works in is probably different from what you would read in most texbooks or learn in college courses.</p>
<p>As an introduction to her work, I would recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYChwJq0310">Complexity a Guided Tour</a> (Youtube) for a good introduction to Complexity in general. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRltq_qWDg">Using analogy to discover the meaning of images</a> (Youtube) as an introduction to her work with analogies.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Alex Miller (the conference organizer) is a fan of Hofstadter's. He invited Hofstadter to keynote at Strange Loop in 2013. He also had <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Brain-Computing">Jeff Hawkins talk about modeling the neocortex at Strange Loop 2012</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#mmullaney">Morgan Mullaney's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about writing games using Lisp and functional programming.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I agree with the <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#mmullaney">talk description</a>; Lisp in games has a long and storied history. The biggest success I know of is Crash Bandicoot, which used a Lisp that allowed the game to get closer to the hardware. There's a nice series of articles <a href="http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/02/02/making-crash-bandicoot-part-1/">about the creation of Crash Bandicoot</a>. The creators wrote their own version of Lisp. <a href="http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/03/12/making-crash-bandicoot-gool-part-9/">Part 9</a> of the series has a nice, detailed description of the language. There's also an article I like about <a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html">writing games in a functional style</a>. John Carmack (of id Software fame) has also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PhArSujR_A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m5s">talking about Lisp and Haskell recently</a>.</p>

However, when we develop a DSL, we are designing a new language and are free to build in a static type system for that DSL. Nathan Sorenson's talk addresses some of the hardest but most important work in developing a type system: the error messages and interoperability. And it seems practical: he'll be developing a query DSL for Datomic.</p>
<p>If you're new to macros, you may want to read the <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/writing-macros/">macro chapter from Clojure for the Brave and True</a>. If you're really interested in Type Theory, you're in for a treat with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev7AYsLljxk">this recording of Robert Harper</a>.</p>

Clojure pulls in ideas from many different languages and paradigms, and also from the broader world, including music and philosophy. The Clojure Gazette shares that vision and weaves a rich tapestry of ideas from the daily flow of library releases to the deep historical roots of computer science.
