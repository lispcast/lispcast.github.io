<p>Summary: <em>There are many great resources out there for learning Clojure. Some of the resources are paid, but fortunately many of the best resources are absolutely free.</em></p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in learning Clojure?</strong> Would you like to get started without risking your money on a book? Is there something that can help you even know whether you want to learn Clojure?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>I learned Clojure for free. In fact, I'm a bit of a cheapskate. For many years I would avoid spending money if there was a free alternative. I also keep an eye on resources that pop up around the internet.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Well, just at the last minute, this interview was finished. Jason Hemann is the organizer of this year's <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jhemann/scheme-14/">Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop</a> that is happening just before the Conj. Tickets are very affordable and still available.</p>
<p>The schemers are inviting everyone to attend <em>Programming Enthusiasts Unite for Great Justice</em>, an after-hours event at 8:30 on Wednesday, November 19 at the Mezzanine Lounge, Capitol City Brewing Company, 1100 New York Ave. I'm going to be there, so say hi!</p>
<p>On with the interview!</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: Tell me a bit about the Scheme Workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hemann</strong>: The Scheme Workshop (or Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop, to use the full title) is an annual meeting for the community of folk interested in Scheme and functional programming generally. The purpose is to report recent developments in the language, to foster collaboration among the members of the community, and for researchers, implementers, and users to present recent work.</p>
<p>The first workshop was held in 2000, making this the Scheme Workshop's 15th anniversary. In previous years we've hosted it with PLI, ICFP, and SPLASH, among other venues. We're excited this year to again be co-located with Clojure/conj.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is something that Clojure (as a language or as a community) can learn from Scheme?</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: I think the Schemer's view of the world offers an interesting comparison for Clojurers. To me, Scheme is a tiny extensible core, one basic data structure (the cons pair), tail recursion, and the ability to redefine almost everything in the language. It is amazing how few primitives you can get away with using in practice. To quote from a recent standard document,</p>
<p>&quot;Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language....&quot;</p>
<p>From this vantage point, Clojure feels like an extremely large and complex language (this is not to say it's the correct or only point of view, of course).</p>
<p>Historically, the design of Scheme has had relatively few compromises---some might say because there wasn't much language to begin with. This feels very different than Clojure, which readily compromises in order to interact with Java seamlessly. For example, Scheme implementations must handle tail calls properly. This isn't to say that Clojure makes the wrong decision--Clojure has different design goals, and unoptimized tail calls makes sense when interacting with Java. But by comparison Scheme feels very uncompromised, and it's fun to play around in such a minimal language with relatively few corner cases.</p>
<p>That design fits well with the Scheme workflow for writing small programs. Many Schemes exist as single standalone executables; you simply run it, and the REPL starts instantly. And then you're programming. There aren't any toolchains to build, projects to setup, or package dependencies to fight with. Compared with other languages' toolchains and workflows, there is very little to get in the way of thinking about a problem, and Scheme feels lightweight and nimble by comparison.</p>
<p>There are obviously tradeoffs to this design, and there can be a strain when trying to move to medium to large scale projects. Scheme has no large standard library, or standard build and versioning tools, or canonical directory layout, or anything like that. When creating large- or even medium-sized applications, the support you get in the Clojure world can be very useful. But when trying to quickly experiment with a new idea, Scheme doesn't have the encumberance of these (admittedly sometimes useful) features.</p>
<p>Scheme has been a useful tool for exploring and explaining new ideas, some of which have found their way into Scheme itself. Its relatively small size has made it a proving ground for language features. The Scheme approach has been to lean toward adding fewer, more highly expressive primitives. An example of this is the Scheme operator call/cc, which subsumes what would otherwise be a variety of distinct primitives.</p>
<p>Another idea that Schemers have explored and then added to the language is hygienic macros. While traditional unhygienic and pseudo-hygienic macros do great things for other lisps, Scheme's hygienic macros and the more recent procedural hygienic macro systems designed and developed in Scheme have really pushed the state of the art forward. The macro systems available in Scheme seem more usable than those of other lisps, and lead to more readable and more reliable code as well.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: So, now the opposite: what can Scheme learn from Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: Well, one thing I haven't mentioned yet is that Scheme is in the process of growing. The Scheme steering committee hopes both to keep Scheme as this small, lightweight language, but also make it a language able to meet &quot;the practical needs of modern software development&quot;. The groups working on the latest language standard are producing both a spec for a small language and a spec for a large language, which is to be, by some metrics, larger than Common Lisp. The small language report is finished and was announced at last year's Scheme Workshop. This year, we will hear an update from John Cowan, the head of the large language working group. I'm excited to hear what they've been up to.</p>
<p>I mention this all because Clojure is a recent, comparatively large lisp designed with the practical considerations of real software development in mind. Clojure provides an example of one way to build a large language and ecosystem, and from which we can learn. The first thing that comes to mind is persistent data structures. Clojure comes out-of-the-box with a suite of persistent data structures that'd make programmers in a lot of other languages envious. The R7 large group has an immutable data structures proposal on the table, and I think that would be a nice addition. Clojure has a number of libraries that could be good additions to the large language.</p>
<p>Too, for a (comparatively) young language you all have---and have had---a broad, vibrant, and growing community. The conj itself is a <em>big</em> event. The recipe for that kind of enthusiasm and growth is something I hope the Scheme community can bring back with us.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What are some resources for Clojurists who want to learn about Scheme to prep for the workshop?</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: Clojurists are already about as well prepared as anybody to learn about Scheme. That's the wonderful thing about being close linguistic cousins. A classic introductory text that uses Scheme to talk about some really neat concepts is Abelson &amp; Sussman's &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot;. Another good resource is &quot;The Little Schemer&quot; by Friedman &amp; Felleisen. It's cute, and as much puzzle book as it is textbook (full disclosure, my advisor is one of the authors). As far as online references, <a href="http://schemers.org">schemers.org</a>, <a href="http://readscheme.org">readscheme.org</a>, and <a href="http://schemewiki.org">schemewiki.org</a> have enough information to keep one busy for quite a while. Also, we've just put up on the <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jhemann/scheme-14">Scheme '14 website</a> the papers that will be presented. Those still hungry for more might be interested in the proceedings of previous years' Scheme Workshops, available at <a href="http://schemeworkshop.org">schemeworkshop.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Thanks for the great interview!</p>

              Elm FRP in Clojure core.async

<p>Summary: <em>Elm is an exciting FRP language. I implemented the FRP part in Clojure using core.async.</em></p>
<p>I like to read research papers. I have ever since I was in high school. <strong>I've always wanted it to be pretty easy to just translate the pseudocode for an algorithm for a paper and then have it working without any trouble.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, this rarely happens. Either the pseudo-code leaves out important details, or it's expressed in terms that are not available abstractions in any language I know. So then <strong>I am left to puzzle it all out</strong>, and who has the time?</p>
<p>A few months ago I read the <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf">fantastic thesis</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/czaplic">Evan Czaplicki</a><sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> where he introduces <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. It includes a novel way to express <strong>asynchronous Functional Reactive Programming</strong> (which he calls <em>Concurrent FRP</em>) and a way to express GUI layouts functionally.</p>
<p><strong>I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf">thesis</a>.</strong> It is very clear and readable, and points you to valuable resources.</p>
<p>The reason I was reading it was because I think <strong>FRP has a bright future</strong>. It's definitely got potential for simplifying the way we write interactive applications. I wanted to learn how it works so that I could build bigger castles in the sky.</p>
<p>Elm FRP is pretty cool. It is, first of all, very few parts. <strong>You build bigger abstractions from those small parts.</strong> It is built so that events trickle through the graph in order. In other words, they're synchronized.</p>
<p>But the other interesting thing is that sometimes you don't want things to be synchronized. What if one of the calculations takes a long time? You don't want the GUI to stop responding to mouse events while that slow thing is happening. Elm lets you segment the graph into different <strong>subgraphs that can propagate concurrently</strong>.</p>
<p>Seriously, just read the thesis.</p>
<p>While I was reading it, I got to <strong>this page where he lays out all of the FRP functions in Concurrent ML</strong>. It's not uncommon for entire Computer Science theses to be written, passed, and published without a line of runnable code. But here it was, in <em>real code</em> (no pseudocode). I don't know ML, but I do know Haskell, which is related. And I started puzzling through it, trying to understand it.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/elm-frp.png" alt="Elm FRP in Concurrent ML" /><p class="caption">Elm FRP in Concurrent ML</p>

<p>By flipping between the text and the code, I got it. And then I realized: <strong>everything I needed to write this was in Clojure with core.async</strong>. So I got to work.</p>
<p>It took a while of playing with different representations, but I got something I can use and that is pretty much a direct translation of the Concurrent ML code from the thesis. I toyed with some deeper factorizations, but I think they only muddy what's going on. And <strong>it runs in both Clojure and ClojureScript</strong>. It's <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/elm-frp">available on Github</a>.</p>
<p>And, of course, I needed to test my creation, so <strong>I ported the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/edit/examples/Intermediate/Mario.elm">Mario example from the Elm website</a></strong>. You have to click on it to start it. Use the arrow keys to walk left/right and up to jump. It captures your keystrokes. Click outside of the box to get your scrolling keys back.</p>
<div id="mario" style="width: 100%; height: 200px" tabindex="100"></div>

<script src="http://www.lispcast.com/files/mario.js"></script>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/elm-frp/blob/master/src/cljs/elm/examples/mario.cljs">The code for Mario.</a></p>
<p>Now, <strong>I didn't write all of the cool GUI stuff</strong> from the second part of the thesis. I was learning Om so I decided to use that. That's why that part is so long. Writing Om components is basically as long as writing HTML + CSS.</p>
<p>And Elm is a language built around these FRP abstractions, so a lot of the signals are built in. I had to write <strong>event handlers to capture the mouse clicks and keyboard events</strong>. But right in the <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/elm-frp/blob/e8a5d222e5f7cb2efd90393a6ff1a55e797a8dd2/src/cljs/elm/examples/mario.cljs#L74">middle of mario.cljs</a>, you'll see a very straightforward translation of the Mario example from Elm.</p>
<p>There are a few differences between the Elm version and the Clojure version. Clojure is untyped, so I was able to <strong>eliminate a channel</strong> used only to carry an input node id. That instead is passed along with the message on a single channel.</p>
<p>Also, I added a node type called &quot;pulse&quot; which I use for emitting time deltas for calculating physics. I'm not sure if Elm internally does something similar for its timers but it seems like the correct solution. The trick is you want to <strong>emit a zero time delta</strong> while other events are firing, and an actual time delta when the timer ticks.</p>
<p>Finally, instead of the graph being global as in the thesis, it's all tied to an &quot;event stream&quot;, which is where you send the events which get channeled to the correct input signal. You can have <strong>multiple event streams and hence multiple graphs</strong>.</p>
<p>The implementation is very straightforward. You have to know the basics of Clojure core.async, plus <a href="http://rupsshankar.tumblr.com/post/66648884392/demystifying-core-asyncs-tap-and-mult"><code>mult</code> and <code>tap</code></a>. core.async brings Clojure a new set of abstractions that let us <strong>tap into more research and learn from more languages</strong>. And that makes me happy :)</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn core.async, I have to recommend my own video course <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/core-async">LispCast Clojure core.async</a>. It teaches the <strong>most important concepts from core.async</strong> using story, animation, and exercises. It is no exaggeration to say that it was the most anticipated Clojure video when it came out. Go check out a <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/core-async#preview">preview</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-true-history">A true history</h3>
<p>Summary: <em>Conveyor belts are strikingly similar to Clojure core.async channels. While it could be a coincidence, there is speculation that conveyor belts were influenced by a deep understanding of core.async.</em></p>
<p><strong>Who invented the conveyor belt?</strong> No one knows for sure. Many historians believe that it was Henry Ford, seeking to mechanize the transportation of car parts from one part of the factory to another. This conservative view is plausible. Henry Ford designed much of the assembly line in his factories.</p>
<p>Despite the simplicity of this explanation, a small minority of researchers believe that there was a man behind Henry Ford who was the true inventor of the conveyor belt. Not much is known about him, but <strong>historians have pieced together a different story</strong>. This article is about that story.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/henry_ford.jpg" alt="Henry Ford in front of his invention." /><p class="caption">Henry Ford in front of his invention.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a classic picture of Henry Ford standing in front of his creation. Recent advances in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk">digital imaging enhancement</a> have allowed us to learn a little more about the people that influenced Ford who, until recently, have <strong>lived within his shadow</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/strange_man.jpg" alt="Strange man who is suspected true inventor of conveyor belt." /><p class="caption">Strange man who is suspected true inventor of conveyor belt.</p>
</div>
<p>While the identity of this man is not known, historians have reassembled a story from bits and pieces of Henry Ford's journals and quotes. It is believed (by those few, brave historians) that <strong>this man is the true inventor of the conveyor belt</strong>. He looks eerily similar to the famed inventor of Clojure, Rich Hickey. However, the chronologies do not match up, so this hypothesis is easily ruled out.</p>
<h3 id="conveyor-belt-similarities-to-core.async-channels">Conveyor belt similarities to core.async channels</h3>
<p>It is well understood that the conveyor belt is a poor, physical compromise on the much more reasonable abstraction of the Clojure core.async channel. As lossy as the copy is, it is still quite useful. <strong>core.async channels and conveyor belts have many properties in common.</strong></p>
<h4 id="things-can-be-put-onto-and-taken-off-of-a-conveyor-belt">Things can be put onto and taken off of a conveyor belt</h4>
<p>The similarity here is uncanny. It is almost as if the inventor of the conveyor belt <strong>had some knowledge of the core.async operations</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="the-conveyor-belt-serves-as-a-buffer">The conveyor belt serves as a buffer</h4>
<p>Again, it is striking that the conveyor belt can serve nearly the same purpose as a core.async channel. On long conveyor belts, the people taking things off and putting things on <strong>might not even know each other</strong>. And for things that take an unknown amount of time, you can just point to the conveyor belt and say &quot;Wait here for the thing you need.&quot; <strong>They don't have to know when or from where it is coming.</strong></p>
<h4 id="things-can-be-taken-off-in-the-same-order-they-are-put-on">Things can be taken off in the same order they are put on</h4>
<p>This is something that perhaps the conveyor belt has lost. While <strong>core.async channels always maintain their own semantics</strong> for choosing which thing is taken next, conveyor belts are basically dumb and expose all of their contents. However, it is clear that you could enforce the common &quot;first-in-first-out&quot; queue behavior by always taking the last item from a conveyor belt.</p>
<h4 id="when-the-conveyor-belt-is-full-the-putter-has-to-wait">When the conveyor belt is full, the &quot;putter&quot; has to wait</h4>
<p>What happens when the conveyor belt fills up? Well, you <strong>wait for some room</strong>. Everyone has had this experience where you're at the supermarket and the cashier is taking too long to ring up your food so the conveyor belt fills up. You just have to wait with a dumb look while they look up the code for celery.</p>
<h4 id="when-the-conveyor-belt-is-empty-the-taker-waits">When the conveyor belt is empty, the &quot;taker&quot; waits</h4>
<p>Conversely to the full belt situation, when the belt is empty the taker must wait. This is what happens when the cashier is faster than the shopper at the supermarket. <strong>There's nothing to do but wait</strong> for some groceries to reach the end of the belt.</p>
<h3 id="differences-between-conveyor-belts-and-core.async-channels">Differences between conveyor belts and core.async channels</h3>
<p>Though the evidence that core.async influenced the development of the conveyor belt is overwhelming, there are some differences due to the <strong>physical limitations of time and space</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="non-instantaneous-transfer">Non-instantaneous transfer</h4>
<p>Though not truly instantaneous, core.async channels do operate at the speed of light. When a value is put onto a channel, <strong>it is immediately available to be taken</strong>. Contrast this with conveyor belts, which slowly move objects along a physical belt.</p>
<h4 id="limited-in-length">Limited in length</h4>
<p>Conveyor belts have finite length. But core.async channels can be passed around just like any other object. They, in fact, are not limited by space at all. Also, the length of a conveyor belt is equivalent to its size as a buffer. But core.async channels have <strong>properly decomplected buffer size from &quot;distance&quot; of travel</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="no-droppingsliding-semantics">No dropping/sliding semantics</h4>
<p>It is quite curious that this important feature of core.async channels has not been copied to conveyor belts. <strong>core.async channels can be set up to drop either the newest value added or the oldest value added.</strong> Conveyor belts that do that are considered defective. The best explanation is that physical goods are so expensive compared to computing ephemeral values that it is uneconomical to trow away any items after they are made.</p>
<p>The jury is still out as to whether core.async influenced the development of conveyor belts. Was Tony Hoare, who invented Communicating Sequential Processes (on which core.async is based) given the secret to CSP by this same man? This hypothesis becomes more convincing when we see the immense similarities between conveyor belts and core.async channels.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>Token Bucket is a simple algorithm for rate limiting a resource. It's easy to understand because you can reason about it in terms of real-world objects. core.async makes this algorithm very clear and easy.</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/token%20bucket.png" alt="Token + BucketImage credits: token and bucket." /><p class="caption">Token + Bucket<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>You know you've got a good abstraction when you find lots of algorithms that are easy and clear to write using them. One algorithm that I really like because it's <strong>practical and simple</strong> is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket">Token Bucket</a>. It's used for <strong>rate limiting a resource</strong>. And it's very easy to write in core.async.</p>
<p>Let me digress a little. Here in the US, we have a complicated voting system. Not only do your presidential votes count only indirectly, but the counting is done with machines that vary from state to state. Some of those systems are so complicated. It's a little scary because it's hard to know how those machines work.</p>
<p>I mean, relatively hard. It's obviously possible to know, if you study enough. But <strong>compare it to papers in a box</strong>. I know there's all sorts of room for corruption in the papers in a box system. But it's understandable by children. Well, as long as they can count.</p>
<p>The token bucket is similarly simple. There's a bucket. You put tokens in it at a certain rate (for instance, once per hour). If you have a token, you can take an action (ride the subway, send a packet, read a file), then you lose the token (it's good for one ride). If you don't have a token, you can wait. <strong>Everything slows down to the rate of tokens falling into the bucket.</strong></p>
<p>It's so simple. It so easily <strong>corresponds to a real-world situation</strong> you can imagine. I love that type of algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="an-implementation">An implementation</h3>
<p>Let's build Token Bucket in core.async.</p>
<p>First, we need a bucket. For that, we'll use a core.async channel with a buffer. Let's just start with size 10.</p>
<pre><code>(def bucket (chan 10))</code></pre>
<p>Bucket is done. Now, we need something to <strong>add tokens to the bucket at a given rate</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>(go
  (while true
    (&gt;! bucket :token)
    (&lt;! (timeout 1000))))</code></pre>
<p>That will add one token to the bucket every second.</p>
<p>We can rate limit an existing channel by <strong>forcing it to take a token before values get through</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>(defn limit-rate [c]
  (let [out (chan)]
    (go
      (loop []
        (let [v (&lt;! c)]
          (if (nil? v) ;; c is closed
            (close! out)
            (do
              (&lt;! bucket) ;; wait for a token
              (&gt;! out v)
              (recur))))))
    out))</code></pre>
<h3 id="corner-cases">Corner cases</h3>
<p>Ok, it's not that simple. There are two corner cases.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What happens when nobody takes a token out of the bucket? Do you keep putting coins in?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer is yes. In the next hour, there are two tokens, so two can come through. But then . . .</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What do you do when the bucket gets really full and a whole bunch of people take tokens out at the same time?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, you let them all through. One token, one ride. There's no other coordination. And that means it's really important to choose the size of your bucket.</p>
<p>The number of tokens your bucket can hold is called the <em>burstiness</em>. It's because when the bucket is full, you could get a rampage of people trying to get on the subway. How many people should be allowed through at that point? <strong>The burstiness is the maximum that should come through at a time.</strong></p>
<p>We have our two parameters: the <em>rate</em> and the <em>burstiness</em>. Let's incorporate all of that.</p>
<pre><code>(defn limit-rate [c r b]
  (let [bucket (chan b) ;; burstiness
        out (chan)]
    (go
      (while true
        (&gt;! bucket :token)
        (&lt;! (timeout (int (/ 1000 r)))))) ;; rate
    (go
      (loop []
        (let [v (&lt;! c)]
          (if (nil? v) ;; channel is closed
            (close! out)
            (do
              (&lt;! bucket) ;; wait for a token
              (&gt;! out v)
              (recur))))))
    out))</code></pre>
<p>The burstiness is taken care of in the size of the buffer. The buffer will fill up if no one takes a token. Since we're using blocking buffers, <strong>putting tokens into a full bucket will block</strong> until something takes a token--exactly as the algorithm describes.</p>
<p>Well, that's it. It's easy. And now <strong>we have a way to limit the rate of a channel</strong>. We can use it to limit the rates of other things, too, like a function call or access to a database. I use it to rate limit an API.</p>
<p>core.async makes this algorithm nice and easy to use. There's a library that does this for you in a very convenient package. It's called <a href="https://github.com/brunoV/throttler">Throttler</a>. Bruno Vecchi has done the work of making this work well as a library. If you'd like to learn core.async, I recommend my <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/core-async">LispCast Clojure core.async videos</a>. It's a gentle and fun introduction to a great topic. You will learn everything you need to write Token Bucket and more!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Steven Yi is next up on the interviews. He will <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#steven-yi">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> about music systems in Clojure. Read the <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-conj-steven-yi">background to his talk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Steven Yi</strong>: I think I came across it online about two years ago when it started to get a bit of a buzz. I had long wanted to learn a Lisp, but Common Lisp and Scheme never really clicked when I tried. Clojure was different though, and since I do a fair amount of Java programming, the possibility to integrate Clojure with my JVM music software Blue helped motivate me to get into it.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Can you briefly describe Blue, Pink, and Score?</p>
<p><strong>SY</strong>: Blue is a music composition environment, written in Java using the Netbeans RCP. It is a graphical environment with a score <a href="http://blue.kunstmusik.com/manual/html/scoreTimeline.html">timeline</a>, graphical instruments, mixer and effects, and more. It uses <a href="http://csound.github.io">Csound</a> as its audio engine and signal processing system. (Disclosure: I'm also one of the core developers of Csound.)</p>
<p>Pink is a Clojure library for building music systems. It features a low-level audio engine, higher-order events, and includes signal generation and processing functions.</p>
<p>Score is a Clojure library for higher-level music work, particularly for generating notes and scores using various strategies. It is designed to be generic and usable with multiple backends. Using Score and Pink together can be particularly effective and expressive, having one language for the full musical stack.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Overtone has been getting a lot of attention lately. How do Pink and Score compare to Overtone?</p>
<p><strong>SY</strong>:Ah yes, certainly the elephant in the room. :) I'll certainly address comparisons to Overtone in more detail during the talk. In a nutshell, Overtone builds upon SuperCollider. Of those two, Pink would compare more to SuperCollider than to Overtone, as it is concerned with low-level audio engine design. Score deals with higher-level abstractions in music, many of which are covered in Overtone. However, because of the full-stack Clojure design between Pink and Score, Score can interact with Pink in ways Overtone/SuperCollider can not. Pink/Score are currently not as mature nor as performant as Overtone/SuperCollider. There's a lot of overlaps between the various systems, and use cases and requirements for a user's project will guide them to one system or the other.</p>
<p>Hopefully that's enough to get going! I think the breakdown of music systems design I'm planning for the talk should hopefully make things clear.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Is there any resource that could help someone new to Clojure, or new to music systems, get the most out of your talk?</p>
<p><strong>SY</strong>: think it's a tough question about music systems as I don't know of any resources out there that really introduce the subject. Having some experience with Overtone would certainly be useful. I can say I'll probably mention <a href="http://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>, <a href="http://csound.github.io/">Csound</a>, <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/">Common Lisp Music</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/nyquist/">Nyquist</a>, and <a href="http://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/">Common Music</a> during the talk:</p>
<p>and perhaps <a href="http://incudine.sourceforge.net/">Incudine</a> and <a href="http://opusmodus.com/">OpusModus</a>:</p>
<p>But that's a long list. :P</p>
<p>Actually, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC-N">Wikipedia link to Music-N</a> would probably be a good place to get going.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you on your adventures?</p>
<p><strong>SY</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kunstmusik.com">website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/kunstmusik">github</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/kunstmusik">twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Thanks, Steven, for a great interview! It was a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>SY</strong>: And thank you too!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Bozhidar Batsov agreed to an interview about his <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#bozhidar-batsov">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> about CIDER, the Clojure Emacs IDE. Read the <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-conj-bozhidar-batsov">background to his talk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Bozhidar Batsov</strong>: I’m very fond of Lisps and I love exploring new programming languages. In 2009 Common Lisp was my favourite Lisp dialect and I was often solving small programming exercises in it. I wanted to do some “real work” in CL, but the ANSI standard had left out basic things like networking, GUI, etc. and relying on distribution-specific extensions didn’t feel right to me. I was working as a Java developer at the time, so when I stumbled upon a news about the release of Clojure 1.0 I was super excited. A practical Lisp seemed like a dream come true to me! I immediately started playing with Clojure and enjoyed it immensely. I was impressed by the immutable data structures, the seamless Java interop and the powerful concurrency primitives. Along the way I developed a deep appreciation for the merits of functional programming and explored a few other functional programming languages.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is CIDER and how did you wind up as its maintainer?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: CIDER is an interactive Clojure development environment for Emacs. It’s pretty similar to <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> (which I consider CIDER’s spiritual ancestor) for Common Lisp and <a href="http://nongnu.org/geiser/">Geiser</a> for Scheme/Racket. People who are not familiar with Emacs should think of CIDER as a Clojure IDE plugin, that provides a ton of useful (Emacs-flavoured) features like interactive code evaluation, code completion, documentation lookup, code navigation and many others.</p>
<p>CIDER is built on top of the popular <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a> server and replaces SLIME + swank-clojure as the standard way to write Clojure programs in Emacs. A lot of the functionality in implemented in terms of reusable nREPL middleware, which makes the project pretty accessible to Clojurists who are afraid of Emacs Lisp. Portions of CIDER’s middlewares are used in other dev tools like vim’s fireplace and Gorilla REPL.</p>
<p>I was an early adopter of CIDER (which was named nrepl.el back then) as I was pretty excited to use a development environment tailored specifically for Clojure (unlike SLIME). The project felt pretty barebone (compared to SLIME) and my Emacs skill were pretty decent, so I started contributing features and improvements to it (I think the first major thing I contributed were the compilation error highlights). About one year after the project started, the original maintainer Tim King had to step back and handed over the maintenance to me. I’ve been hacking on CIDER pretty actively ever since and I have epic plans for its future! :-)</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is the best resource for someone who wants to get started with CIDER?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: I guess that for people familiar with Emacs the best resource would be <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/README.md">the project's README itself</a>.</p>
<p>Users who are new to Emacs should probably start with some gentler tutorial like <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html">http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html</a> or perhaps <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/">http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/</a>.</p>
<p>While not strictly necessary, I’d encourage people to also have a look at <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/blob/master/README.md">cider-nrepl’s README</a>.</p>
<p>A more extensive user guide (perhaps in texinfo format) and a few screencasts are on the roadmap, but I cannot promise when/if they’ll become a reality. Lots of bugs to squash and features to add prevent me from spending more time on improving the documentation.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is the best resource for someone (like me) who has migrated from SLIME and might not know all the cool stuff that's in there now?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: The README lists all prominent config options and commands (or at least I think it does). <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">The changelog</a> is also a great place to discover new features.</p>
<p>There’s a wiki entry on differences with SLIME, but it hasn’t been updated in a while, so people won’t learn much from it. Guess I should find some time to update it!</p>
<p>I’m always planning to write blog posts and do short screencasts for important new features, but unfortunately I never find the time to do so. Who knows, maybe next year...</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow your adventures online?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: There are plenty of opportunities for people to stalk me online. :-) Here are some of the best options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov">https://github.com/bbatsov</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs">https://github.com/clojure-emacs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">https://twitter.com/bbatsov</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: One last question: If Clojure were a zoo animal, what would it be and why?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: A bear! Bears are (arguably) cute, smart and powerful. They are good at pretty much everything - they can run very fast, climb trees and swim. Does this remind you of a certain programming language?</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: This was a great interview and I enjoyed it!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Paul deGrandis gave a nice interview about his <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#paul-degrandis">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> about data-driven systems. Read the <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-conj-paul-degrandis">background to his talk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Paul deGrandis</strong>: I was a very early Clojure adopter. I came from Python (and before that a mix of C/C++/Java/Python), but I had always used Common Lisp to prototype ideas. Once I saw Clojure publicly announced, I gave it a shot and instantly identified with the Clojure Trinity: Simplicity, Power, and Focus. I began using it in all of my proof-of-concept work, and as I became confident in the language, integration with the platform, and my own skill set, I also started putting it into production.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Can you define Data-Driven systems briefly?</p>
<p><strong>PdG</strong>: Data-driven systems capture their interactions and operations as values - they are one possible conclusion of programming with values. We see this done in Datomic - queries are expressed as data. This concept is easily mapped to other systems - services, client-side applications, and more. Note that is more than just, &quot;data all the things,&quot; this is, &quot;data all the thing's things.&quot; Another example: Pedestal routes are represented as data (&quot;data all the things&quot;), but imagine if we captured the expression of an entire service as data. Imagine the properties that naturally fall out from that design decision. My talk walks through a real project that pushed this design decision as far as possible, and the steps that other developers can follow to do the same for their own systems.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: At Cognitect, they talk about Data &gt; Functions &gt; Macros. Is that what your talk is about?</p>
<p><strong>PdG</strong>: My talk, at a <em>very</em> high level is about &quot;Data &gt; Functions &gt; Macros,&quot; but it's mostly about modeling entire systems (not just interfaces) as data, why you'd want to, and why it's hard. It definitely challenges the previous notions (established by existing tooling) of what the conclusions of &quot;programming with values&quot; actually are (or could/should be). Tangentially, I'll talk about DSLs, but only in regards to constraining your domain as a means to increase expressiveness.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: I'm a big fan of working with data. But I've also seen its dark side. I've seen it pushed too far, or in the wrong area, to where it would have been better to use code. Have you noticed this? How do you avoid that?</p>
<p><strong>PdG</strong>: I have indeed noticed it and it's a topic within my talk. Two crucial pieces of any great design (in software or otherwise) are the external constraints imposed by the problem, and the internal constraints imposed by the designer. Both are important, but it seems common that people overlook self-imposing constraints - and one needs them to achieve a really great design. I don't necessarily agree that capturing a system in data can be pushed too far, but I think it can be done without constraint or design intent - which produces a useless system. The crux is knowing that limitation and working within it. Outside of those limitations and constraints, one should fall back to foundation - regular Clojure code, etc.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is one thing you want someone to be able to do after they watch your talk?</p>
<p><strong>PdG</strong>: I want someone to come away with a set of techniques to envision, constrain, and design data-driven systems. I want to create a spark that encourages Clojure developers to look beyond the initial merits of programming with values, and see further-reaching impact within their own systems - how to turn our ecosystem into a set of super powers.</p>
<p>I hope to provide a compelling example of how this approach plays out in production systems, and the general metrics and project impact it has.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What resources would you recommend to a beginner so they could maximize their understanding of your talk?</p>
<p><strong>PdG</strong>: My talk touches upon a lot of themes covered in some inspiring and informative talks: Tim Ewald's keynote from last year's Conj (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShEez0JkOFw">Programming with Hand Tools</a>), Rich Hickey's GOTO conference Keynote (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values">The value of values</a>), and previous Conj talks. I'm still searching for literature and books that I like on the topic, but I haven't hit any that I'd strongly recommend.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow your adventures online?</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure rode an animal, what animal would it ride?</p>
<p><strong>PdG</strong>: A very serious pony.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Thanks for a great interview. It was informative.</p>
<p><strong>PdG</strong>: Thanks a ton! I really appreciate all of this!</p>

The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-conj-anna-pawlicka">background to her talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Anna Pawlicka</strong>: During my final year at university I was looking for a contract work or a summer internship and my recruiter suggested a big data startup. Description mentioned Clojure so I solved some 4clojure problems and they sparked my interest. Computer Science course I studied was mostly based on Java so it was refreshing if not challenging to try functional programming. I got a Clojure in Action book, applied for the internship and luckily was offered the job. It was a fun summer: lots of Cascalog queries, friendly Clojure Dojos and interesting talks organised by London Clojure Community. It felt like home and you don’t walk away from that feeling. I stayed for both the language and community.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: You've been presenting and blogging a lot about Om. What are you using Om for and why?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: We’ve been recently working on a building performance platform at Mastodon C (project is open sourced). It’s built around high volumes of data and big part of it was UI programming. We were looking for something that performs well but isn’t t too complex and Om came out just in time for us to solve this problem. We’ve built the entire UI using Om and we combined it with d3.js and core.async for nice data visualisations and user interaction. I don’t think we’d be able to achieve that using vanilla JavaScript. Sure, there were some bumps along the way but the overall reusability makes it worth a while. Outside of my day job I’m working on a in-browser genetic algorithm testing tool, using Om and Quil, but with all the presenting and other activities I had to pause the development for a while.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: I've used React or Om for a few things and it quite simply enables me to develop UI interaction that would be too intricate otherwise. How has your experience with Om been relative to other frameworks?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: I haven’t used any frameworks as it’s just easier to mix and match various Clojure/ClojureScript libraries depending on one’s needs. Om was the first library we’ve tried for interacting with React and it suited our needs well enough that we haven’t had the need to try anything else. If you choose a framework, like let’s say Hoplon, you have to go with its programming model and you lose the ability to control every part of your stack.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: You say you're using Om with d3.js. Om is a very functional style, while d3 uses mutation pervasively. How does the integration work? How well do they work together?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Fortunately both are driven by data so having d3 visualisations render on your application state change makes perfect sense. I use interop a lot, and although it doesn’t look as nice as pure ClojureScript, it does the job. We can easily replace iteration methods like map and reduce with their ClojureScript alternatives. The only problem is the type coercion between Clojure’s data structures and JavaScript’s Object. It’s not always immediately clear which one should be used where. The perfect option would be to control SVG via Om (or similar library) and use C2’s functions to calculate path data. But I haven’t tried that myself yet. Charts I’ve been working on are quite complex and d3 comes with this gold mine of resources that none of the other visualisation libraries has. I’m not yet done experimenting though.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Can you explain the basic models of Om and d3?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: D3 performs data-driven DOM manipulation, e.g. you can build a bar chart out of an array of numbers and when your data changes so will your chart. D3 can manipulate any part of DOM and has lots of helper functions to compute our visualisations. React/Om works on DOM as well - we write functions that translate our data into a DOM, but the difference is that the DOM is virtual. Each time the data changes, React/Om compares the old and new state and computes the minimal set of transformations that will be applied to the real DOM. DOM operations are slow so naturally this virtual representation speeds things up by skipping unnecessary transformations. This means that both Om and d3 want to be in control of the DOM inside our component. To make use of both libraries, you can either have Om take care of everything (but this means we need to write functions to compute paths, scales, etc.), or you could use d3’s scales, projection helpers and path generation while having Om generate and manage SVG, or you can have an empty div rendered by Om and allow d3 to generate and manipulate the SVG inside. The latter is the most common approach, probably because we leave the decision whether to re-render to Om (skipping any insignificant data changes), and when Om decides to render the component, d3 takes care of the rest. We combine the best of both.</p>
<p>My talk will include some of that, with examples, since you can’t have a dashboard without a nice chart :)</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: I see. It sounds like they work well together. I wouldn't have guessed that.</p>
<p>In the talk you mention live data. How does your system handle that?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: I don’t have an actual system that I plan to demo - the talk is based around various ways to create, reuse and combine Om components to display data. Long polling and HTTP streaming are available through <a href="http://http-kit.org/">HTTP Kit</a>, but I also like how <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente">Sente</a> combines that with core.async. But the focus is mainly on the components themselves - how you can mix and match them.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Really cool.</p>
<p>Talks are always limited in time, and there's lots of context that you assume people have (or wish they have). What is something people can learn more about to help them get ready for your talk?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: I will try to keep the talk as self contained as possible, but I won’t be able to cover things like the basics of web development with ClojureScript - this would be material for a separate talk. However, more and more people are using ClojureScript so I hope most of the attendees shouldn’t have a problem with that. Those who feel that they need to prepare more will find lots of resources online.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow your adventures online?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: The usual: <a href="http://twitter.com/AnnaPawlicka">Twitter</a>, my <a href="http://www.annapawlicka.com/">blog</a> and GitHub <a href="https://github.com/annapawlicka">account</a>. I’m also often on #clojure and #clojurescript IRC channels if someone wants to chat.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Ok. One last question: when they make a movie about programming languages, who will play Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: That's a tricky one! I'd say Leonardo DiCaprio since he's one of the best actors yet still without an Oscar (read: very good but underappreciated) :-)</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Thanks for a great, informative interview.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Thanks for putting this together. It was my first interview and it was fun :)</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The next interview is with Julian Gamble. His <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#julian-gamble">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> is about core.async and ClojureScript. Read the <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-conj-julian-gamble">background to his talk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Julian Gamble</strong>: It was about 2007, I was a Java Programmer toying with Rails. I was reading Steve Yegge and his amazing but incendiary blog posts. These had a big theme on languages and expressiveness.</p>
<p>I got curious enough to play with Common Lisp and Racket. I eventually worked through The Little Lisper - and found it hugely inspiring. I also read SICP and Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming and was amazed (coming from Java) at what was possible with functional programming and homoiconicity.</p>
<p>In 2008 I was looking for a way to combine the power of Lisp and my Java background. I had a look at ABCL and Kawa and found they didn't really have much of a community behind them.</p>
<p>Then the Rich Hickey videos started coming out, &quot;Clojure for Java Programmers&quot; etc. Then lots of Java/Lisp people started coming out of the woodwork. I was fascinated by the design choices made and how opinionated the language was. I was delighted by the community that seemed to have come from thin air.</p>
<p>In 2009 Stu Halloway's Programming Clojure book came out and I devoured it. Then I went back and worked through the Little Lisper chapters in Clojure - and found functional programming had a lot more to it than a first-year course for students in the 80s. This meant idiomatic functional programming didn't work like that anymore. (Although the idea of building a Lisp from a few primitives is still very elegant).</p>
<p>In 2011 a Clojure User group started up in Sydney run out of Thoughtworks. This was a fantastic chance to meet up with people who programmed and developed their skills just for the joy of it - rather than just to pay a mortgage.</p>
<p>In 2013 Dave Thomas started running LambdaJam in Australia, and it meant that the functional programming community because more social and more willing to look at each others ideas across languages. It also meant we developed a shared appreciation for the heritage of functional programming. We also developed a deeper appreciation of academic ideas and their linkage back to our practice.</p>
<p>So now in 2014 when Rich Hickey gives a talk on Transducers, and explains that folds are fundamental - I go and read the linked papers from Hutton and Bird. Then I can go and talk about this with my local community of Clojure people. This is something that I wouldn't have done two years ago.</p>
<p>Clojure has been a great ride!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: In your talk description, you mention that you will relate core.async to the concurrency semantics we already know. Can you explain this briefly?</p>
<p><strong>JG</strong>: The assumption here is that most Clojure people have a Java or C# background. From this background they would have an understanding of how to put process on a thread, similar to how we might use a future in Clojure. Alternatively, Clojure people may have seen how we can pass a function to an agent in Clojure.</p>
<p>Now it is true that core.async go blocks have some very specific queue sleep/wait semantics (CSP) that make it different to other concurrency models. In addition, core.async in JavaScript runs as part of the single-thread model of JavaScript, so it isn't semantically a thread, more of a 'process'.</p>
<p>Given those assumptions, the primitives we find for doing concurrency in core.async are very similar to the concurrency models we have seen in the past in OO languages or in Clojure.</p>
<p>In this talk we'll take a look at an example of taking a well known graphical example in Clojure, port it to ClojureScript and core.async. What we find is that many of the Clojure concurrency paradigms have a natural analogue in ClojureScript and core.async.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Are there any topics to read up on or resources to look at that could help a beginner make the most of your talk?</p>
<p><strong>JG</strong>: First thing to look at is David Nolen's <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/02/100000-processes/">10,000 processes</a> and also <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/02/100000-dom-updates/">this one</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/swannodette/swannodette.github.com/blob/master/code/blog/src/blog/processes/core.cljs">Take a look at the source code</a> and try and understand what it is doing.</p>
<p>Also take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enwIIGzhahw&amp;t=32m20s">Tim Baldridge's 2013 Conj talk at 32:20</a></p>
<p>Also take a look at <a href="https://github.com/halgari/clojure-conj-2013-core.async-examples/blob/master/src/clojure_conj_talk/core.clj#L568-612">the code here</a>: (lines 568-612)</p>
<p>Watch the 1969 version of The Italian Job.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow your adventures online?</p>
<p><strong>JG</strong>: They can follow me on twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/juliansgamble">@juliansgamble</a>.</p>
<p>Or they can send me an email @ <script type="text/javascript">

<p>(I've also been known to present at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/clj-syd/">clj-syd on meetup.com</a> - but that is probably only of interest to Sydney readers).</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: One last question: If Clojure could eat, what would be its favorite food?</p>
<p><strong>JG</strong>: Well I'm a huge fan of Dan Friedman's work on The Little Lisper/Schemer - which has frequent food references, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The book will at random reserve an empty page and state:</p>
<p>THIS SPACE RESERVED FOR JELLY STAINS!</p>
<p>So the answer would have to be PBJ sandwich!</p>
<p>(But for all the British, European, Australian and New Zealand Readers - we all know it as peanut butter and strawberry jam - and some might be puzzled by the combination of these two condiments, but would still appreciate Friedman's book.)</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Thanks for a great interview!</p>
