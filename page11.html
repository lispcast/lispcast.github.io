<p>Summary: <em>Code style is important, but way less important than content. Yet everyone talks about style because it's easier. Let's talk about content. I'll start with some bullet points.</em></p>
<p>In fiction writing, there is a fine, but visible, line between style and content. Style is your <strong>choice of words and grammar</strong> while you're telling a story. Content is <strong>the parts of the story</strong> itself. It's the characters, the plot devices, the motivations, etc.</p>
<p>Style is important. Classic works of literature usually have a good style. But content is more important. Good style can enhance a story. But a story can be retold many times, each with a different style, because a good character and story can stand on its own. <strong>No amount of style is going to save crappy storytelling</strong> with uninteresting characters. It didn't work for The Matrix 2 &amp; 3, and man, did not help at all in the Star Wars prequels.</p>
<p>You can roughly divide programming decisions along a similar line. Coding style versus coding content. <strong>So much advice falls on the style side.</strong> It talks about variable naming, function length, what parts of a language not to use.</p>
<p>Where is all the stuff about code content? How do we choose an algorithm? How do we pick a data structure? Basically, how do we translate a real-world problem into a computational model? How do we determine if a program correctly models the problem? How do we judge if one model is better than another? The answer is so simplistic. <strong>A model fits a problem if the structure of the model matches the structure of the problem.</strong></p>
<p>Structure, structure, structure.</p>
<p>Here are some bullet points:</p>
<h3 id="choose-the-right-collection">1. Choose the right collection</h3>
<p>Here's a good example that we should all be familiar with. How do you choose between an array and a map? Well, if your problem is to do things in order, an array is the better choice because it is naturally ordered. If your problem is &quot;I have an x and I need a y&quot;, a map is probably better, because maps associate one value with another. <strong>The data structure's properties mirror the properties of the problem.</strong></p>
<h3 id="factor-your-code">2. Factor your code</h3>
<p>Refactoring is improving the style of your code without changing the content. But <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/stop-refactoring-and-start-factoring">factoring</a> is changing the structure of your code to reveal the <strong>underlying structure of the problem</strong>. This is the only reliable way to get a one-to-one mapping between code and reality.</p>
<h3 id="determine-the-essential-structure-of-the-problem">3. Determine the essential structure of the problem</h3>
<p>I have <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/java-learn-from-clojure#represent-computation-not-the-world">written before</a> about finding the essential idea in a problem. Object Oriented Programming advice tends to recommend <strong>picking each of the objects in the real world and creating a class for each</strong>. So, if you're modeling students and courses, regardless of the problem you're solving, you should have a student class and a course class.</p>
<p>This practice comes from the early days of OOP, when it was still used a lot in simulations. I can see the benefit of representing each thing in your simulation as an object. But we're not building a simulation. <strong>A university registration system is not a university simulator.</strong> We are not simulating students. We are not simulating courses. We need to be looking at the problem we're trying to solve.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-it-already-done">How is it already done?</h4>
<p>I really think the best way is to look at the process that is already being used. If you're hired to replace a manual, pen-and-paper system, you have a head start over a new system. Computerizing an existing process is easier because <strong>the problem is already well-understood</strong>. Go ask the registrar's office how they are doing it.</p>
<p>Let's say that each department keeps a large list of all the courses they give each semester. For each semester, they start a new notebook and make a page for each course. As students register, they write down their name. If they unregister, they cross them out. They leave room for enough students between each course, sometimes skipping a page. They put post-it notes sticking out the top so they can quickly turn to the page for a course when a student comes in the office.</p>
<p>Wow! Your job is now way easier. You just have to <strong>replicate that notebook in code</strong>. That is so much easier than modeling students and courses. And once it's done, you have a place for improvements that are only possible in a computer.</p>
<h4 id="finding-the-essence">Finding the essence</h4>
<p>But let's say it's a new university, trying to get a head start on old universities by organizing everything on a computer. So there's no existing process. You've got to make it up.</p>
<p>What do you do if the structure is not obvious? How do you determine the structure of a poem? Reading. Re-reading. Underlining. Arrows. Notes. Clarifying definitions. Basically, look for structure. Dig it all up. Then use your judgment about what is important. There often is not one single kind of structure, but <strong>a constellation of structure</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="factor-out-incidence-from-essence">4. Factor out incidence from essence</h3>
<p>The incidental structure just happens because of the choice of solution instead of the structure of the problem. <strong>The structure inherent in the problem is essential structure.</strong></p>
<p>In the notebook used for registering students, there are some incidental implementation details that you don't want to replicate. In the notebook, they left some blank space for more students after each page so that they wouldn't run out of room. But running out of room is not an issue in a computer (no university is that big). So <strong>you can leave that part out</strong>.</p>
<p>But less obviously, the fact that there is a separate page for each course is also incidental. It's not important that the students in one class all be stored in a single place. What's important is that at any time, a student can register for the course (random access!) and that at any time, a teacher can list all students in a particular course (random access!). We need a way to <em>project</em> a list of students <em>quickly enough</em> in a course from however it is stored.</p>
<p>But it turns out that, if you factor correctly and find the essence, <strong>your solution should be generic</strong>. Why? Because structure is generic. It is pure content. The correct solution to this problem is to make a system to manage many-to-many relationships. Relational databases can do this easily with one table. You could make a <code>ManyToMany&lt;A, B&gt;</code> class. Those are implementation details that are incidental. What's essential is the many-to-many part.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We need more discussion about the content of programs. Style is important, but we need people to create acronyms and rules of thumb for choosing program constructs. The <em>Design Patterns</em> book (and movement) were important in this respect. It documented patterns of common structure. But <strong>it failed to do a good job teaching the how</strong>, and added an air of mystery.</p>
<p>Although this process is language-agnostic, Clojure is great for finding essential structure. One thing I like about Clojure is that the <strong>data structures are described in terms of their usage structure</strong>. And Rich Hickey has expressed many times that to understand a problem, to design a solution, we must <strong>pull things apart</strong> into its essential parts.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn Clojure and see how it might help you think in terms of structure, I can recommend my <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure</a> video course. It builds up skills from complete beginner to decomposing a problem into a generic solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#michał-marczyk">Michał Marczyk's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about Persistent Data Structures that are available as libraries to Clojure. Given Michał Marczyk's contributions, this should be a great talk.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure comes with several Persistent Data Structures built-in. There is no need to copy them to share them, since they are immutable. And they are efficient at making modified copies as well, since they share structure. A great introduction to Clojure's Persistent Data Structures is <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Identity-State-Rich-Hickey">this talk by Rich Hickey</a>. For a deeper dive into how they work, check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/28760673">Daniel Spiewak's talk</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Although the built-in data structures are great, there's no reason not to have more! Other data structures might be more appropriate at different times, given that they have different performance characteristics. It's great that there is development in these areas.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#julian-gamble">Julian Gamble's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async/">core.async</a> in ClojureScript. core.async is an implementation of CSP for Clojure and ClojureScript. It allows for concurrency, and communication using an abstraction called channels. It is similar to built-in facilities in the Go programming language.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>core.async provides two main abstractions: go blocks and channels. Go blocks are lightweight processes that give the basic type of independent concurrency. To coordinate and communicate between the go blocks, the go blocks take values from and put values to channels.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async/">core.async</a> is important because it is a very powerful way to structure your code. Further, core.async is a library, not a core feature of the language, even though in many languages it is a fundamental part of the language. Finally, core.async gives Javascript (through ClojureScript) a much needed asynchrony model that is more expressive than callbacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#rich-hickey">Rich Hickey's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about Transducers, a new abstraction in the core language (coming in <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md#changes-to-clojure-in-version-17">Clojure 1.7</a>).</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming">Transducers</a> are a way to define the standard map, filter, and mapcat functions that does not bake in the idea of creating a list as output. Instead, it takes that as a parameter. It's hard to explain, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTbuzafcII">Rich Hickey does a great job</a> making it clear.</p>
<p>The talk has no abstract at the time of this writing, so I can't say what he will add to the Strange Loop talk he gave. But I would guess that it will be more deeply aimed at Clojure programmers.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Transducers are very new. They haven't even been released yet. However, they've already made a splash, with static typists trying to come up with their type signature, and implementations in other libraries.</p>

<h3 id="talk-variants-are-not-unionstalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#jeanine-adkisson">Variants are Not Unions</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#jeanine-adkisson">Jeanine Adkisson's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about using Variants in Clojure. Variants are a way to represent different cases of value that belong to the same type. For instance, a linked list type might be represented as two cases: an empty list and a tuple of an element and a list. A <em>tag</em> distinguishes between the two cases.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>In a dynamically typed language, we often play fast and loose with type. For instance, we might write a function with a giant <code>cond</code> statement in the body that does little more than switch on type. But how do we know we've checked all the types we need to? Variants solve this problem.</p>
<p>Variants are a key feature of Haskell and ML. Adkisson mentions that there is no standard way of representing them in Clojure, which is true, though several commonplace conventions exist for getting <em>some</em> of the uses of Variants. However, there is not a common convention for noting all of the possible tags and ensuring that all cases are covered in a conditional. The talk description also mentions <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.typed">core.typed</a> (a type system for Clojure, which does not have Variants) and <a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> (a database written by the creators of Clojure).</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Adding Variants to Clojure is a good example of the Clojure community's excitement about borrowing good ideas from a variety of languages. And the fact that a new kind of type can be introduced that works in the dynamic language, a type system, and a database is promising for the future of idea borrowing in Clojure.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#glenn-vanderburg">Glenn Vanderburg's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about implementing the TeX algorithms in Clojure. TeX is a typesetting engine, often used through LaTeX. TeX was written by Donald Knuth in order to typeset his opus <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>If you're interested in a good understanding of typesetting using TeX, you can't do better than the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jgross/www/LaTeX/texbook.pdf">TeXbook</a>, written by Knuth himself. It's an excellent guide to the TeX language and the underlying semantics. If you'd like to hear an interview with Knuth about why he decided to pause his life's work to solve digital typesetting, watch <a href="http://www.webofstories.com/play/donald.knuth/51">this</a> (and the following segments).</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>TeX is written in an imperative style with mutation and is difficult to understand. <a href="http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~heckmann/abstracts/neuform.html">Other attempts</a> have been made to re-implement the algorithms in a functional style. The work to re-implement typesetting in Clojure in a functional style can be instructive both of the specific algorithms and for imperative legacy systems in general.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#lucas-cavalcanti">Lucas Cavalcanti and Edward Wible's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>, a database that extends the concurrency semantics of Clojure into a distributed database. They have created generic solutions to common problems using Datomic.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Datomic is an append-only database. That means you never delete or modify existing records. It appears that the speakers have used this property to solve some tricky problems, including HTTP caching, audit trails, mobile sync, and authorization. A nice introduction is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iaIwiemqfo">this talk by Rich Hickey</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Datomic is a relatively new database and people are still working out the best usage patterns for it. Its data model is quite flexible, so you often have to enforce your own structure. While that may be more work, the promise is that lots of other problems with traditional databases become non-issues. This talk promises to show us a glimpse of those practical benefits of Datomic.</p>

<h3 id="talk-jvm-creature-comfortstalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ghadi-shayban">JVM Creature Comforts</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ghadi-shayban">Ghadi Shayban's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about the Java Virtual Machine. In case you don't know, the JVM was <strong>originally designed by James Gosling</strong> and originally only hosted Java. Recently, the JVM has become the <strong>target platform for some very popular languages</strong>, including Groovy, JRuby, Scala, and of course Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I always recommend <strong>studying up on history</strong>. James Gosling gave a talk a while ago about <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/gosling-jvm-lang-summit-keynote">How the JVM Spec Came To Be</a>. It's a personal history that chronicles the experiences that led up to the design decisions that are embedded in the JVM today. A good introduction to how the JVM method invocation works in bytecode (very basically) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOOXa06y96A">Charles Nutter's keynote at JAX 2012</a>. It's also a good introduction to <em>invokedynamic</em> and <em>Method Handles</em>, also mentioned in the talk description.</p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/dynamic_invocation_in_the_vm"><em>invokedynamic</em></a> is a way to <strong>dynamically dispatch</strong> based on language-specific semantics in a fast way. <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/method_handles_in_a_nutshell"><em>Method Handles</em></a> are a way to <strong>refer to a method directly</strong> as first-class values. Some other things mentioned: <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html">value types</a> are a proposal to support immutable aggregate types directly in Java. <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/valhalla/spec-classdyn.html">classdynamic</a> is an idea for instantiating <em>patterns</em> of classes.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>The JVM is evolving. The growing number of languages that compile to the JVM are influencing that evolution. <em>invokedynamic</em> is an example of such an influence. It is used extensively in JRuby and Nashorn (the new Javascript implementation on the JVM). The JVM is shaping up to be an even better host than when Rich Hickey chose to target it.</p>

<p>Cursive Clojure uses static analysis to provide some nice features that are hard to come by in Clojure editors, including underlining errors. Also, since it is built into IntelliJ, it handles projects (including projects with some Java classes) seamlessly.
