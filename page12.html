<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#glenn-vanderburg">Glenn Vanderburg's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about implementing the TeX algorithms in Clojure. TeX is a typesetting engine, often used through LaTeX. TeX was written by Donald Knuth in order to typeset his opus <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>If you're interested in a good understanding of typesetting using TeX, you can't do better than the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jgross/www/LaTeX/texbook.pdf">TeXbook</a>, written by Knuth himself. It's an excellent guide to the TeX language and the underlying semantics. If you'd like to hear an interview with Knuth about why he decided to pause his life's work to solve digital typesetting, watch <a href="http://www.webofstories.com/play/donald.knuth/51">this</a> (and the following segments).</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>TeX is written in an imperative style with mutation and is difficult to understand. <a href="http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~heckmann/abstracts/neuform.html">Other attempts</a> have been made to re-implement the algorithms in a functional style. The work to re-implement typesetting in Clojure in a functional style can be instructive both of the specific algorithms and for imperative legacy systems in general.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#lucas-cavalcanti">Lucas Cavalcanti and Edward Wible's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>, a database that extends the concurrency semantics of Clojure into a distributed database. They have created generic solutions to common problems using Datomic.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Datomic is an append-only database. That means you never delete or modify existing records. It appears that the speakers have used this property to solve some tricky problems, including HTTP caching, audit trails, mobile sync, and authorization. A nice introduction is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iaIwiemqfo">this talk by Rich Hickey</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Datomic is a relatively new database and people are still working out the best usage patterns for it. Its data model is quite flexible, so you often have to enforce your own structure. While that may be more work, the promise is that lots of other problems with traditional databases become non-issues. This talk promises to show us a glimpse of those practical benefits of Datomic.</p>

<h3 id="talk-jvm-creature-comfortstalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ghadi-shayban">JVM Creature Comforts</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ghadi-shayban">Ghadi Shayban's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about the Java Virtual Machine. In case you don't know, the JVM was <strong>originally designed by James Gosling</strong> and originally only hosted Java. Recently, the JVM has become the <strong>target platform for some very popular languages</strong>, including Groovy, JRuby, Scala, and of course Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I always recommend <strong>studying up on history</strong>. James Gosling gave a talk a while ago about <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/gosling-jvm-lang-summit-keynote">How the JVM Spec Came To Be</a>. It's a personal history that chronicles the experiences that led up to the design decisions that are embedded in the JVM today. A good introduction to how the JVM method invocation works in bytecode (very basically) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOOXa06y96A">Charles Nutter's keynote at JAX 2012</a>. It's also a good introduction to <em>invokedynamic</em> and <em>Method Handles</em>, also mentioned in the talk description.</p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/dynamic_invocation_in_the_vm"><em>invokedynamic</em></a> is a way to <strong>dynamically dispatch</strong> based on language-specific semantics in a fast way. <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/method_handles_in_a_nutshell"><em>Method Handles</em></a> are a way to <strong>refer to a method directly</strong> as first-class values. Some other things mentioned: <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html">value types</a> are a proposal to support immutable aggregate types directly in Java. <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/valhalla/spec-classdyn.html">classdynamic</a> is an idea for instantiating <em>patterns</em> of classes.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>The JVM is evolving. The growing number of languages that compile to the JVM are influencing that evolution. <em>invokedynamic</em> is an example of such an influence. It is used extensively in JRuby and Nashorn (the new Javascript implementation on the JVM). The JVM is shaping up to be an even better host than when Rich Hickey chose to target it.</p>

<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Cursive Clojure uses static analysis to provide some nice features that are hard to come by in Clojure editors, including underlining errors. Also, since it is built into IntelliJ, it handles projects (including projects with some Java classes) seamlessly. I have heard more than one person mention that they prefer it to Emacs after using Emacs for years.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#brian-goetz">Brian Goetz's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is the keynote, which doesn't have a description (which is common with keynotes). I would only be guessing if I said what the talk was about. But here are the things that I wouldn't be surprised to hear in a keynote by the Java Language Architect at a Clojure conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java Lambdas (their design and implementation)</li>
<li>Future features of Java/JVM (that they're working on now)</li>
<li>JVM and dynamic languages like Clojure</li>
<li>How Java will approach concurrency</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever he talks about, it will be important.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Rich Hickey made the decision to design Clojure as a hosted language. Clojure is tied to the JVM. Also, <strong>JVM languages are gaining popularity</strong>, and they obviously must play a part in Oracle's strategy. This talk has the potential to set the tone for Java's interaction with Clojure in the future.</p>

<p>Brian Goetz is quite an important figure in the Java world. He's the Java Language Architect at Oracle (the company that produces Java). He was instrumental in bringing lambdas to Java 8. The book he wrote, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/ref=cm_lmf_tit_15?tag=lisp0b-20">Java Concurrency in Practice</a> is one of the books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Bookshelf/lm/R3LG3ZBZS4GCTH">Rich Hickey's reading list</a>.</p>
<p>He's been giving a talk recently called <a href="https://vimeo.com/100753521">Lambda: A Peek Under the Hood</a> about the design decisions and how they are finally implemented in Java Bytecode.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#bozhidar-batsov">Bozhidar Batsov's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>, which is the <strong>Clojure IDE and REPL built into Emacs</strong>. You should know that previously, the <strong>CIDER project was known as nrepl.el</strong> and it replaces SLIME, which is what we used to use in Emacs. CIDER connects to an <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a> server.</p>
<p>If you'd like to install and use CIDER, check out the <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/using-emacs-with-clojure/">Using Emacs with Clojure</a> chapter from <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Emacs with CIDER is the <strong>most popular IDE</strong> according to the <a href="http://cemerick.com/2013/11/18/results-of-the-2013-state-of-clojure-clojurescript-survey/">2013 State of Clojure Survey</a>. Bozhidar Batsov took over the project one year ago and CIDER has <strong>added many new features</strong>. I will enjoy hearing about all the things I don't use because I don't know about them.</p>

<h3 id="talk-generative-integration-teststalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ashton-kemerling">Generative Integration Tests</a></h3>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ashton-kemerling">Ashton Kemerling's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about Generative Testing (also known as Property-based Testing) as applied to integration tests. Generative Testing is a methodology for generating many tests randomly to find failing cases (as opposed to writing each test by hand). It often <strong>finds difficult bugs</strong> and can present a very <strong>small, reproducible failing case</strong>.</p>
<p>The best talk I have seen about Generative Testing is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q">John Hughes' talk at Clojure/West</a>. John Hughes wrote Quickcheck for <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck1">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://www.quviq.com/">Erlang</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/reiddraper">Reid Draper</a> has recently ported it to Clojure in the form of <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">test.check</a>. He also gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMhNINPo__g">a talk at Clojure/West about test.check</a>.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Generative testing is great for unit testing. It has already found bugs in Clojure itself. What's not obvious is how to apply the technique to integration tests to test the interaction of different systems. This talk appears to be an <strong>experience report</strong> from a company that has actually used Generative Integration Tests.</p>

<h3 id="talk-om-nom-nom-nomanna">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#anna-pawlicka">Om nom nom nom</a></h3>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#anna-pawlicka">Anna Pawlicka's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolen</a>'s project, started in December of 2013. It's essentially a wrapper around Facebook's <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. It's a way to define HTML components functionally and has been making quite a splash.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtwq3QtddY">David Nolen's talk at Clojure/West</a> relates Om and React to the history of the GUI. It's the best high-level introduction I can imagine and discusses the ideas that motivated its design. If you watch one video to prepare for this talk, this should be it.</p>
<p>For a good talk about React itself, check out Pete Hunt's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3KksH8gfcQ">Be Predictable, Not Correct</a>. He's one of the main contributors to React and has been evangelizing it.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>React is significant because it is very different from other Javascript MVC frameworks. It takes a very functional approach instead of object oriented. React makes much easier to reason about the UI. Om has also made waves because <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/">David Nolen has shown</a> that using <strong>ClojureScript's immutable data structures with React can be faster than Backbone.js</strong> (a very popular library) even though immutable data is commonly considered slower than mutable data.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-for-the-conj">Prepare for the conj</h3>
<p>People have been asking me how they can get ready for all of the great talks lined up for <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a>. <strong>There are many topics, and people are feeling overwhelmed.</strong> They might know about some of the ideas, but not all of them.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to do just <strong>a little homework</strong> before the conj so that you would be sure to <strong>maximize your understanding</strong> and be able to participate in the conversations afterward?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, googling any topic reveals lots of material, and it's not always the best. <strong>It would take hours</strong> to sift through the background material for just one topic.</p>
<p>That's why I am publishing the Pre-conj Prep. Each day, I will send you <strong>one or two things to read or watch</strong> (whichever is better) to get up to speed on the topics of the talks (which are listed on the Clojure/conj speakers page). I'm used to finding great content for the Clojure Gazette, so you can be sure <strong>it will be helpful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conferences are ongoing conversations and explorations.</strong> Speakers discuss trends, best practices, and the future by drawing on the rich context built up in past conferences and other media. That rich context is what Pre-conj Prep is about. I want to enhance everyone's experience at the conj by surfacing that context. With just a little homework, we can be better prepared to <strong>understand and enjoy the talks and the hallway conversations</strong>.</p>
<p>There are 18 talks listed. After I go through all of them (that will take 18 days), I will go further than the published topics into other helpful stuff to get ready for a great <em>conj</em>. I am trying to get <strong>interviews with the speakers, restaurant/event/city guides, and more</strong>, to make the conference a special one.</p>

<p>The conj is a single-track conference, which means all talks happen in series in a single auditorium. The advantage of that is that <strong>everyone has a very similar experience</strong>. We all see the same talks (unless you skip one). The disadvantage is that you can't choose a different talk if you don't know about a topic. <strong>Preparation is key to having a great experience.</strong></p>
<p>As you probably know, conferences are social events. The talks are mostly an excuse to get together, meet each other, and talk about Clojure. The conversations that happen after a talk can be very rewarding. But if you don't understand why the topic is important, you may feel left out. Don't let that happen! <strong>You're travelling far and paying (or expensing) lots for the ticket, hotel, and travel.</strong> Make the most of it!</p>
