<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#bozhidar-batsov">Bozhidar Batsov's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>, which is the <strong>Clojure IDE and REPL built into Emacs</strong>. You should know that previously, the <strong>CIDER project was known as nrepl.el</strong> and it replaces SLIME, which is what we used to use in Emacs. CIDER connects to an <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a> server.</p>
<p>If you'd like to install and use CIDER, check out the <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/using-emacs-with-clojure/">Using Emacs with Clojure</a> chapter from <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Emacs with CIDER is the <strong>most popular IDE</strong> according to the <a href="http://cemerick.com/2013/11/18/results-of-the-2013-state-of-clojure-clojurescript-survey/">2013 State of Clojure Survey</a>. Bozhidar Batsov took over the project one year ago and CIDER has <strong>added many new features</strong>. I will enjoy hearing about all the things I don't use because I don't know about them.</p>

<h3 id="talk-generative-integration-teststalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ashton-kemerling">Generative Integration Tests</a></h3>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ashton-kemerling">Ashton Kemerling's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about Generative Testing (also known as Property-based Testing) as applied to integration tests. Generative Testing is a methodology for generating many tests randomly to find failing cases (as opposed to writing each test by hand). It often <strong>finds difficult bugs</strong> and can present a very <strong>small, reproducible failing case</strong>.</p>
<p>The best talk I have seen about Generative Testing is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q">John Hughes' talk at Clojure/West</a>. John Hughes wrote Quickcheck for <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck1">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://www.quviq.com/">Erlang</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/reiddraper">Reid Draper</a> has recently ported it to Clojure in the form of <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">test.check</a>. He also gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMhNINPo__g">a talk at Clojure/West about test.check</a>.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Generative testing is great for unit testing. It has already found bugs in Clojure itself. What's not obvious is how to apply the technique to integration tests to test the interaction of different systems. This talk appears to be an <strong>experience report</strong> from a company that has actually used Generative Integration Tests.</p>

<h3 id="talk-om-nom-nom-nomanna">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#anna-pawlicka">Om nom nom nom</a></h3>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#anna-pawlicka">Anna Pawlicka's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolen</a>'s project, started in December of 2013. It's essentially a wrapper around Facebook's <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. It's a way to define HTML components functionally and has been making quite a splash.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtwq3QtddY">David Nolen's talk at Clojure/West</a> relates Om and React to the history of the GUI. It's the best high-level introduction I can imagine and discusses the ideas that motivated its design. If you watch one video to prepare for this talk, this should be it.</p>
<p>For a good talk about React itself, check out Pete Hunt's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3KksH8gfcQ">Be Predictable, Not Correct</a>. He's one of the main contributors to React and has been evangelizing it.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>React is significant because it is very different from other Javascript MVC frameworks. It takes a very functional approach instead of object oriented. React makes much easier to reason about the UI. Om has also made waves because <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/">David Nolen has shown</a> that using <strong>ClojureScript's immutable data structures with React can be faster than Backbone.js</strong> (a very popular library) even though immutable data is commonly considered slower than mutable data.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-for-the-conj">Prepare for the conj</h3>
<p>People have been asking me how they can get ready for all of the great talks lined up for <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a>. <strong>There are many topics, and people are feeling overwhelmed.</strong> They might know about some of the ideas, but not all of them.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to do just <strong>a little homework</strong> before the conj so that you would be sure to <strong>maximize your understanding</strong> and be able to participate in the conversations afterward?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, googling any topic reveals lots of material, and it's not always the best. <strong>It would take hours</strong> to sift through the background material for just one topic.</p>
<p>That's why I am publishing the Pre-conj Prep. Each day, I will send you <strong>one or two things to read or watch</strong> (whichever is better) to get up to speed on the topics of the talks (which are listed on the Clojure/conj speakers page). I'm used to finding great content for the Clojure Gazette, so you can be sure <strong>it will be helpful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conferences are ongoing conversations and explorations.</strong> Speakers discuss trends, best practices, and the future by drawing on the rich context built up in past conferences and other media. That rich context is what Pre-conj Prep is about. I want to enhance everyone's experience at the conj by surfacing that context. With just a little homework, we can be better prepared to <strong>understand and enjoy the talks and the hallway conversations</strong>.</p>
<p>There are 18 talks listed. After I go through all of them (that will take 18 days), I will go further than the published topics into other helpful stuff to get ready for a great <em>conj</em>. I am trying to get <strong>interviews with the speakers, restaurant/event/city guides, and more</strong>, to make the conference a special one.</p>

<p>The conj is a single-track conference, which means all talks happen in series in a single auditorium. The advantage of that is that <strong>everyone has a very similar experience</strong>. We all see the same talks (unless you skip one). The disadvantage is that you can't choose a different talk if you don't know about a topic. <strong>Preparation is key to having a great experience.</strong></p>
<p>As you probably know, conferences are social events. The talks are mostly an excuse to get together, meet each other, and talk about Clojure. The conversations that happen after a talk can be very rewarding. But if you don't understand why the topic is important, you may feel left out. Don't let that happen! <strong>You're travelling far and paying (or expensing) lots for the ticket, hotel, and travel.</strong> Make the most of it!</p>

              4 Features Javascript can steal from Clojure(Script)
            </a>

<p>Summary: <em>ClojureScript adds a lot of value on top of the Javascript platform. But some of that value can be had directly in Javascript without using a new language.</em></p>
<p><strong>ClojureScript is a dialect of Clojure that compiles to Javascript.</strong> It lets you run Clojure in a browser or on Node. Just like Clojure, it has immutable data structures, literals for those data structures, macros, and core.async support.</p>
<p>These features are very powerful and they give ClojureScript a lot of power above Javascript. But a lot of that power can be had in Javascript through libraries, tools, and now some ES6 features. If you can't make the switch to ClojureScript, these tools might help you out. If you've heard of all the cool stuff that ClojureScript can do, well, this might be <strong>a good way to dip your toes in</strong> before you jump in.</p>
<h3 id="use-clojurescripts-awesome-data-structures-in-javascriptmori">1. <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/mori/">Use ClojureScript's awesome data structures in Javascript</a></h3>
<p>David Nolen, the maintainer of ClojureScript, has wrapped up the <strong>ClojureScript immutable data structures to be used as a Javascript library</strong> which he calls <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/mori/">mori</a>. He's put in a lot of work to make it convenient to use from Javascript. It's not just the datastructures. It also has all of the functional goodness that makes them powerful to use.</p>
<h3 id="write-csp-like-core.async-without-core.asynccsp">2. <a href="https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp">Write CSP like core.async without core.async</a></h3>
<p>CSP stands for Communicating Sequential Processes. It's a model of concurrency that is <strong>used in Go and in Clojure core.async</strong>. It's a powerful tool, especially in Javascript, where you don't have threads. Once you use it, you'll never go back.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to Generators in EcmaScript 6, <strong>you can write CSP code in Javascript</strong>. There's a library called <a href="https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp">js-csp</a> that does just that.</p>
<h3 id="better-data-formats-than-jsontransit">3. <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format">Better data formats than JSON</a></h3>
<p>JSON is a great format for data exchange, but <strong>it has limitations</strong>. One of the biggest limitations is that it is not extensible. You cannot define new types. Wouldn't it be nice to have values that get parsed as Javascript Date objects? Another limitation is that map keys can only be strings.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">edn format</a> is <strong>Clojure's literal syntax made into a data format</strong>. It includes many data structures, including symbols, keywords, sets, maps, lists, and vectors. It is also extensible with tagged literals, meaning a small tag can be placed in front of a value to indicate the semantic meaning of that value. There are a couple of built-in tags, such as #instant for Dates and #uuid for, yes, UUIDs. But the important thing is <strong>you can define your own and define how they get parsed</strong>.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/shaunxcode/jsedn">Javascript library</a> for parsing and generating edn.</p>
<p>edn is a great format, but parsing it in Javascript is never going to be as fast as parsing JSON. The JSON parser is written in C and highly optimized. Because of that limitation, the folks who build Clojure wrote <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format">Transit</a>, which is <strong>a data format that serializes to JSON</strong>. It's semantically equivalent to edn, so it's extensible, but it's also JSON, so it's fast to parse. There's a <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js">Javascript implementation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="write-your-own-syntax-with-macrossweet">4. <a href="http://sweetjs.org/">Write your own syntax with macros</a></h3>
<p>Macros are one of those legendary things Lisps are known for. They let you write code that writes code. Well, that's kind of a meaningless statement. Think of it more like extensible syntax. You can <strong>write a new type of syntax</strong> which will be <strong>translated to plain Javascript</strong>.</p>
<p>There's a macro system for Javascript called <a href="http://sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a>. The macro system is similar to the one found in Scheme systems. This isn't directly from Clojure, but you get the same power. <strong>Macros are a great way to extend a language.</strong> You no longer have to wait for a new language feature to be implemented. You can do it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Javascript community is active and growing. There are plenty of smart people making cool libraries that can revolutionize your programs. One of Clojure's philosophies is to have <strong>a small core language and extend</strong>, to the extent possible, using libraries<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. So, those libraries can often be leveraged outside of Clojure, which is true in the case of mori. Or they are simply standardized to work cross-platform, like edn and Transit. CSP and macros are simply powerful tools that can be added to many languages.</p>
<p><strong>Go give these tools a try.</strong> If you like them, you might like Clojure/ClojureScript. They will be here when you're ready. And when you <em>are</em> ready, I must recommend <a href="www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure</a>. It's a video course designed and produced to take you from zero to Clojure.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>Clojure has been successfully adopted by many companies. There are many resources available by people who did the hard work of introducing Clojure to their team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you want to get paid to write Clojure?</strong> Let's face it. Clojure is fun, productive, and more concise than many languages. And probably more concise than the one you're using at work, especially if you are working in a large company. You might code on Clojure at home. Or maybe you want to get started in Clojure but don't have time if it's not for work.</p>
<p>One way to get paid for doing Clojure is to <strong>introduce Clojure into your current job</strong>. I've compiled a bunch of resources for getting Clojure into your company.</p>
<p>Take these resources and do your homework. <strong>Bringing a new language into an existing company is not easy.</strong> I've summarized some of the points that stood out to me, but the resources are excellent so please have a look yourself.</p>
<h3 id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h3>
<p>Before you begin your quest to introduce Clojure, you're going to need a good strategy. By far the best presentation of a strategy is by Neal Ford. Neal Ford is a Director at ThoughtWorks and has a <strong>great strategy for introducing Clojure</strong> into an existing company. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WLgzCkhN2g">Watch this video</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Spread Clojure outside of the company.</li>
<li>Get a groundswell of people inside the company.</li>
<li>Use Clojure for things it's great at.</li>
<li>Get the Clojure jar file included.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your company happens to be using Ruby, Joshua Ballanco has some great tips for <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-rails-immutant">How to Sneak Clojure Into Your Rails Shop</a>.</p>
<p>Sean Corfield helped move a sizeable legacy application to Clojure. He's got some <a href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/clojure-in-the-enterprise/">good, sobering advice</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be ready to explain the lack of a framework.</li>
<li>OOP habits are ingrained.</li>
<li>Don't underestimate the difficulty.</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of great <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/01/lessons-learned-while-introducing-new.html">advice from someone who's actually done it</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find allies.</li>

<h3 id="material-for-other-developers">Material for other developers</h3>
<p><a href="http://getprismatic.com">Prismatic</a> has been using Clojure to great success. They've written about <a href="http://blog.getprismatic.com/om-sweet-om-high-functional-frontend-engineering-with-clojurescript-and-react/">how <strong>Clojure is used throughout their stack</strong></a>. This is a great introduction to answer the question &quot;Why Clojure?&quot;. Spread <a href="http://blog.getprismatic.com/om-sweet-om-high-functional-frontend-engineering-with-clojurescript-and-react/">this post</a> whenever anyone asks <em>why?</em>.</p>
<p>Leo Polovets polled Clojurists at Factual and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-would-someone-learn-Clojure">summarized their answers</a> to <strong><em>Why Clojure?</em></strong>.</p>
<p>A while ago, <a href="http://wit.io/posts/clojure-all-grown-up">this great post</a> was trending on Hacker News. It explains <strong><em>Why Clojure?</em></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="material-for-the-project-manager">Material for the project manager</h3>
<p>If you'd like a <strong>high-level overview of the business advantages to using Clojure</strong>, you can do a lot worse than asking Cognitect, the company that develops Clojure itself. They've published a <a href="http://cognitect.com/consulting/case-studies/roomkey">case study</a>, meant for non-tech folks, to understand the implications. It's focused mainly on Datomic, but it touches on Clojure.</p>
<p>Though a little hyperbolic, <a href="https://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/two-months-early/">this post</a> is <strong>a good one for the skeptical manager</strong>, the one who wonders whether their team can really learn a new technology quickly enough to justify the cost.</p>
<p>For those who <strong>like to follow industry trends</strong> and what others are recommending, look no further than the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. It's a compendium of recommendations, published regularly, that takes a <strong>realistic view of a constantly changing landscape</strong>. <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/clojure">Clojure has been rated at <em>Adopt</em> since October 2012</a>. A lot of secondary Clojure technologies are also on the radar, including <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/core-async">core.async</a>, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/om">om</a>, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/datomic">Datomic</a>, and <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a>.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>Lisp is viewed as difficult and academic but it is a great language for hacking a solution together.</em></p>
<p>I used to be in a carpool with other developers. We would drive an hour to work each way. And sometimes we'd talk about programming languages. Once I was talking about why Common Lisp wasn't more popular. Someone answered <strong>&quot;people just want to hack something together&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>That took a while to unpack and it felt like many conversations I had with that group. Without exploding all of the context, I'll just say that he meant that <strong>Common Lisp was less amenable to quickly building a solution than Java</strong><sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. That notion caused my head to spin and I didn't know how to respond.</p>
<p>So I'll respond here, now (5 or 6 years later!). <strong>Lisp was made to explore solutions quickly.</strong> Lisp is often seen as a difficult, academic language. But Lisp has several things that make it a beautiful language for hacking a solution together.</p>
<h3 id="the-repl">1. The REPL</h3>
<p><strong>You can type code in and it will run.</strong> Right there. The entire language is available without having to open a text file. You can experiment on a solution, testing as you go. This is much faster than having to write a main method.</p>
<h3 id="incremental-compilation">2. Incremental compilation</h3>
<p>You can redefine a function. Any code that calls that function will now use the new definition. You no longer have the edit-compile-run cycle. <strong>You can make changes and fixes much faster.</strong></p>
<h3 id="data-structures">3. Data structures</h3>
<p><strong>Even the humble Lisp list is better than most of what Java gives you.</strong> Lists can represent linear data, trees, or associative data. But more importantly, the interface is powerful. There are many operations built to use lists, so you're compounding effectiveness on top of everything built in. And if you bring in Clojure's data structures, there's no comparison.</p>
<p>In Java, you can use Lists and Maps. But most of the time, people will create a new class to represent their data. And <strong>making a new class means you have to write all of the methods</strong>. And that is definitely slower than using an existing data structure with existing methods.</p>
<h3 id="less-code">4. Less code</h3>
<p><strong>Lisp is less verbose than Java.</strong> If you're trying to go quickly, one limiting factor is how fast you can type the code in.</p>
<p>I purposefully left out a lot of the features of Lisp that make it great because some of them are considered &quot;advanced&quot;. I want to keep the list down to <strong>those basic things that you're going to have to use in order to use the language</strong>. The &quot;advanced&quot; features require expertise in order to be more efficient at them. <strong>You can be more effective in Lisp with a small cheatsheet of syntax and functions.</strong></p>
<p>I think it's pretty clear that <strong>Lisp is superior to Java for &quot;hacking&quot;</strong>. It was developed to experiment with programs interactively. And it serves that purpose very well. If you think you'd like to learn a modern Lisp, I suggest learning from <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure</a>. It's a great video series that takes you from zero knowledge to a deep understanding of functional programming.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>I go over a real-world example of how atoms and immutable values allow you to compose constructs in ways that are easy to reason about and less prone to error.</em></p>
<p>The other day I was in IRC #clojure and someone asked a good question. They had code like the following, and they couldn't understand why <strong>they couldn't modify a map</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>(def state (atom {}))

(doseq [x [1 2 3]]
  (assoc @state :x x))

(println @state)
</code></pre>
<p>What does this print? Well, the asker wanted it to print <code>{:x 3}</code>. But it printed <code>{}</code>. To understand what's happening, <strong>let's go step by step</strong>.</p>
<p><code>{}</code> creates an empty map. It's literal syntax for a <em>constructor</em> for a map. This one happens to be empty.</p>
<p><code>(atom {})</code> takes the empty map that was just created and passes it to the function <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/atom/"><code>atom</code></a>, which constructs a new <code>clojure.lang.Atom</code>. Atoms are objects, and its current state is the empty map we just passed in.</p>
<p><code>(def state (atom {}))</code> defines a new var called <code>state</code> in the current namespace.</p>
<p>At this point, we've got a variable called <code>state</code> whose value is an atom that holds an empty map.</p>
<p><code>(doseq [x [1 2 3]]</code> loops over the numbers 1, 2, and 3. <code>x</code> will be bound to each of those numbers, in turn.</p>
<p><code>@state</code> gets transformed into <code>(deref state)</code>, which returns the current value of <code>state</code>. <code>:x</code> is a literal keyword, and <code>x</code> is a reference to the <code>x</code> bound inside the loop.</p>
<p><code>(assoc @state :x x)</code> creates a <em>new map</em> by taking the current value of <code>state</code> (which happens to be <code>{}</code>) and associating <code>:x</code> with <code>x</code> (which will be <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code> as the loop happens). The value is returned by <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/assoc"><code>assoc</code></a>, and then thrown away, since it isn't bound to anything.</p>
<p>Then <code>(println @state)</code> will print the current value of <code>state</code>, which still is <code>{}</code>.</p>
<p>This code shows a common problem that beginners face in Clojure: how do <strong>immutable data structures</strong> (like maps) and the <strong>concurrency primitives</strong> (like <code>atom</code>) work together to manage state?</p>
<p>The answer is quite simple (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">in the Rich Hickeyan sense</a>) and elegant. <strong>By separating the ideas of value and state, Clojure has made it easy to express precisely the behavior you want in concurrent systems.</strong></p>
<p>The value is the map. It is immutable. It cannot change. It is a single value, and it will always be the same. That means <strong>threads can share the value with no worries that one of them will change it</strong>.</p>
<p>The state is the atom. It's a mutable object. And being an object, it has methods that define its interface. In the code above, we saw that you can call <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/deref"><code>deref</code></a> on an atom to get its current value. <code>deref</code> is basically a getter.</p>
<p>The main way to <em>change</em> the value of an atom is using <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/swap!"><code>swap!</code></a>. <code>swap!</code> takes an atom and a function (plus optional arguments) and <strong>calls the function on the current value of the atom</strong>. It then sets the value of the atom to the return value of the function. So let's use that to fix the code.</p>
<pre><code>
(def state (atom {}))

(doseq [x [1 2 3]]
  (swap! state assoc :x x))

(println @state)
</code></pre>
<p><code>swap!</code> takes the atom (<code>state</code>) and a function (<code>assoc</code>) and some arguments (<code>:x x</code>). It calls <code>assoc</code> on the current value of <code>state</code> with those extra arguments and sets the value of the atom to the return value of the function.</p>
<p>The <code>swap!</code> expression is almost (but not) the same as this code:</p>
<pre><code>
(reset! state (assoc @state :x x)) ;; never do this
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/reset!"><code>reset!</code></a> changes the state of the atom but without regard to the current value. This new code is bad because it's not thread-safe. <strong>Use <code>swap!</code> if you need to use the current value to determine the new value.</strong></p>
<p>So what does an atom do? What does it represent?</p>
<p>Atoms guarantee one very important thing: that <strong>each state is calculated from the last state</strong>. The <code>swap!</code> operation is <em>atomic</em>. No matter how many threads are trying to change the value, each change is calculated from the previous value and no previous values are lost. That's its contract as an object and it's one of the important ways that <strong>Clojure helps with concurrency</strong>.</p>
<p>How can a value be lost?</p>
<p>If we have two threads, each trying to change <code>state</code> in the same incorrect way (using <code>reset!</code>), the order of evaluation will have several steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>(deref state)   ;; call this value *1</code></li>
<li><code>(assoc *1 :x x) ;; call this value *2</code></li>
<li><code>(reset! state *2)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the threads are running concurrently, the operations have a chance of interleaving their steps in unwanted ways. For instance, threads A and B might interleave like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A: <code>(deref state)    ;; call this value *1A</code></li>
<li>A: <code>(assoc *1A :x x) ;; call this value *2A</code></li>
<li>B: <code>(deref state)    ;; call this value *1B</code></li>
<li>B: <code>(assoc *1B :x x) ;; call this value *2B</code></li>
<li>B: <code>(reset! state *2B)</code></li>
<li>A: <code>(reset! state *1A)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>What happened? On line 6, A set the value of <code>state</code> to the value it calculated on line 2. So <strong>B's work is completely discarded</strong>. That's probably not what was intended. What's worse is that that is one of many possible interleavings, some of which work and some don't. Welcome to concurrency!</p>
<p>What you probably wanted was to make sure that <em>no</em> work is discarded. You want the operation to be <em>atomic</em>. That's why it's called an atom. <code>swap!</code> is atomic. A <code>swap!</code> to an atom occurs &quot;all at once&quot;, instead of on three lines like the <code>reset!</code> example. If two threads are doing <code>swap!</code>, there are two possible interleavings.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A: <code>(swap! state assoc :x x)</code></li>
<li>B: <code>(swap! state assoc :x x)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>And</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>B: <code>(swap! state assoc :x x)</code></li>
<li>A: <code>(swap! state assoc :x x)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>These are usually what you want. If <em>only one</em> or <em>neither one</em> works, <strong>atom is not the right construct for you</strong>.</p>
<p>So there you go. Atomic mutable state with immutable values gives you a nice, <strong>composable concurrency semantics</strong>. You could do it with locks but it's harder to ensure you're doing it correctly. It's slightly higher-level than locks yet it provides tremendous value. <strong>Atoms are easier to reason about and less prone to errors.</strong></p>
<p>If you'd like to learn the basics of Clojure, I recommend my video course called <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure</a>.

<p>Summary: <em>I like languages with a small core that is extensible. The languages tend to be weird and require less code to bootstrap.</em></p>
<p>I know of two ways to bootstrap a language.</p>
<p>The first way is probably more traditional. I'll call the first way Type 1. In Type 1, you write a bare-minimum compiler for your language in a host language. So maybe you write a Lua compiler in C. Then you write a Lua compiler in Lua. Then you compile your compiler. Now you have a compiler, written in Lua. You can add to it and modify it without ever having to touch the C code again. You have the advantage of writing the features of your language (Lua) in a higher-level language (Lua). And finally, as you add features to your compiler, you can use those to add more features. There's some leverage.</p>
<p>I like the second way better. I'll call it Type 2. In Type 2, you write a small, powerful set of abstractions in the host language. For instance, you write an <a href="http://piumarta.com/software/id-objmodel/">object system in C</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/AlexandreAbreu/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S">stack and dictionary in assembler</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/34258286c5bc3cc72ca212fceb34e6d61359cb1b/src/jvm/clojure/lang/Compiler.java#L3740">lexical closures in Java</a>. Then you write a compiler that targets those abstractions. If the abstractions are chosen correctly, your compiler is done. You can begin building abstraction on top of abstraction without touching the compiler.</p>
<p>There are a few things to note:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Type 2 languages (Lisp, Smalltalk, FORTH) tend to be weird because they were birthed in a different way. The abstractions, though powerful, are often raw.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 2 languages can be bootstrapped faster. The core is often much smaller than a full-featured compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 2 languages tend to require less code in general. I guess it's because you're writing most of it in a language that is compounding leverage.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 2 languages are more easily ported, since all you have to do is rewrite the core. Type 1 languages, depending on how they are built, can require you to re-bootstrap or write a cross-compiler.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, I believe that both Type 1 and Type 2 are viable options for language-building. I prefer Type 2. If Type 2 intrigues you, you should learn Lisp (or FORTH or Smalltalk). I recommend the <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure videos course</a>.</p>

<p>Update: <em>After talking with several people, I've decided that my writing was really unclear. I've done some major editing to make it as clear as I can. Thanks to everyone who commented and helped me clarify my thinking and writing.</em></p>
<p>I was recently <a href="http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/062-eric-normand">on the Cognicast</a> and I mentioned something really important to me, but I did not go that deep into it.</p>
<p>Clojure, and Lisps in general, are <em>imperative languages</em>. Yes, they are good for doing <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/what-is-functional-programming"><em>functional programming</em></a>, but their <strong>main paradigm is executing lists of commands in order</strong>.</p>
<p>On the podcast I mentioned the first imperative example that came to mind, which was the <code>do</code> form, which executes each expression in the body and returns the value of the last expression. <strong>You would only want to execute an expression and throw away its value for its <em>side effects</em>.</strong></p>
<p>But why is that important to me? It got me thinking about a deeper but related idea.</p>
<p>Clojure is a <em>relatively</em> transparent layer above the JVM. I say &quot;relatively&quot; because languages do get quite a bit more opaque<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. But it manages to be powerful through well-chosen abstractions.</p>
<p>I should be a little more specific about what I mean by &quot;transparent&quot; and &quot;opaque&quot;. This should be the most controversial part of this post, so I want to get this right. These are not formal definitions. <strong>Transparency/opaqueness measures abstractions.</strong> Opaque abstractions show less of the underlying machinery. Transparent abstractions show their machinery. This is a spectrum.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Clojure's functions are rather opaque. Defining a function (with <code>fn</code>) in Clojure creates a class and instantiates it with the values from its lexical environment. This happens without having to think about classes. You're not thinking about the machinery. The machinery leaks out sometimes, like when you're looking at stack traces. But in general, an illusion is maintained.</p>
<p>But Clojure's <code>def</code> form is pretty transparent. You do have to think about what it's doing, about the current namespace, the order of the <code>defs</code> in a namespace, etc. There is not much of an illusion to maintain.</p>
<p>Haskell has a well-defined execution semantics. It's formally defined and you can step through the execution of a Haskell program by hand if you want. In that sense, it's imperative. But the execution order is obscured by the somewhat opaque abstraction of <em>lazy evaluation</em>. <strong>Clojure's execution order is more or less directly the execution order of the JVM it runs on--hence more transparent.</strong></p>
<p>The reason this is important is that <strong>Clojure's strategy is to be transparent</strong> unless there is significant gain. This is part of what is meant by &quot;embracing the host&quot;. Haskell's strategy is orthogonal to the transparency/opaqueness axis. Haskell aims to be formally well-defined. Formal semantics allows deep static analysis and program transformation.</p>
<p>Besides the strategy of being transparent, what I like even more about Clojure is that the <strong>many abstractions are <em>defined in the same abstractions</em> that you have available as a programmer</strong>.</p>
<p>This is from the <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/def/">docstring of def</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creates and interns a global var with the name of symbol in the current namespace (*ns*) or locates such a var if it already exists. If init is supplied, it is evaluated, and the root binding of the var is set to the resulting value. If init is not supplied, the root binding of the var is unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating a var? I can do that. Interning it? I can do that, too. Setting the root binding? Easy! The core can be kept minimal because abstractions can build on each other. If you get the abstractions right, the amount of code you have to write in your implementation language is small.</p>
<p>And this gets to the heart of it: <em>you</em> can write a Lisp yourself. Many people have. You can <strong>write an easy Lisp compiler in a weekend</strong> and build features on top of it, almost <strong>never having to change the original compiler</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the magic of <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/two-kinds-of-bootstrapping">bootstrapped languages</a> like Lisps. They have a <strong>small core that you need to get right, then everything else can be written in that core</strong>. It's the ultimate minimal virtual machine.</p>
<p>What's the relationship between bootstrapping and transparency? <strong>The more opaque the abstractions, the more the language must do to maintain the illusion.</strong> Lisps are easy to bootstrap because the abstractions chosen are either transparent and trivial to implement (like <code>def</code> or <code>if</code>) or opaque and powerful (like <code>fn</code>).</p>
<p>I like Lisps (and Clojure) because <strong>I feel that I can understand them and build them myself</strong>. I don't <em>actually</em> understand everything, but I <em>could</em> if I tried. Somewhere along the way I developed a deep interest in bootstrapping. <strong>Bootstrapping is compounded leverage.</strong> You build small abstractions on top of the previous ones, and use those to build yet grander ones.</p>
<p>If you like this attitude toward programming languages, <strong>you should learn a Lisp</strong>. I suggest Clojure, and I recommend the <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure video series</a>. You'll learn about building up powerful abstractions, one layer at a time, in a small amount of code.</p>
