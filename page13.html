<h3 id="talk-jvm-creature-comfortstalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ghadi-shayban">JVM Creature Comforts</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ghadi-shayban">Ghadi Shayban's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about the Java Virtual Machine. In case you don't know, the JVM was <strong>originally designed by James Gosling</strong> and originally only hosted Java. Recently, the JVM has become the <strong>target platform for some very popular languages</strong>, including Groovy, JRuby, Scala, and of course Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I always recommend <strong>studying up on history</strong>. James Gosling gave a talk a while ago about <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/gosling-jvm-lang-summit-keynote">How the JVM Spec Came To Be</a>. It's a personal history that chronicles the experiences that led up to the design decisions that are embedded in the JVM today. A good introduction to how the JVM method invocation works in bytecode (very basically) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOOXa06y96A">Charles Nutter's keynote at JAX 2012</a>. It's also a good introduction to <em>invokedynamic</em> and <em>Method Handles</em>, also mentioned in the talk description.</p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/dynamic_invocation_in_the_vm"><em>invokedynamic</em></a> is a way to <strong>dynamically dispatch</strong> based on language-specific semantics in a fast way. <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/method_handles_in_a_nutshell"><em>Method Handles</em></a> are a way to <strong>refer to a method directly</strong> as first-class values. Some other things mentioned: <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html">value types</a> are a proposal to support immutable aggregate types directly in Java. <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/valhalla/spec-classdyn.html">classdynamic</a> is an idea for instantiating <em>patterns</em> of classes.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>The JVM is evolving. The growing number of languages that compile to the JVM are influencing that evolution. <em>invokedynamic</em> is an example of such an influence. It is used extensively in JRuby and Nashorn (the new Javascript implementation on the JVM). The JVM is shaping up to be an even better host than when Rich Hickey chose to target it.</p>

<p>Cursive Clojure uses static analysis to provide some nice features that are hard to come by in Clojure editors, including underlining errors. Also, since it is built into IntelliJ, it handles projects (including projects with some Java classes) seamlessly. I have heard more than one person mention that they prefer it to Emacs after using Emacs for years.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#brian-goetz">Brian Goetz's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is the keynote, which doesn't have a description (which is common with keynotes). I would only be guessing if I said what the talk was about. But here are the things that I wouldn't be surprised to hear in a keynote by the Java Language Architect at a Clojure conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java Lambdas (their design and implementation)</li>
<li>Future features of Java/JVM (that they're working on now)</li>
<li>JVM and dynamic languages like Clojure</li>
<li>How Java will approach concurrency</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever he talks about, it will be important.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Rich Hickey made the decision to design Clojure as a hosted language. Clojure is tied to the JVM. Also, <strong>JVM languages are gaining popularity</strong>, and they obviously must play a part in Oracle's strategy. This talk has the potential to set the tone for Java's interaction with Clojure in the future.</p>

<p>Brian Goetz is quite an important figure in the Java world. He's the Java Language Architect at Oracle (the company that produces Java). He was instrumental in bringing lambdas to Java 8. The book he wrote, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/ref=cm_lmf_tit_15?tag=lisp0b-20">Java Concurrency in Practice</a> is one of the books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Bookshelf/lm/R3LG3ZBZS4GCTH">Rich Hickey's reading list</a>.</p>
<p>He's been giving a talk recently called <a href="https://vimeo.com/100753521">Lambda: A Peek Under the Hood</a> about the design decisions and how they are finally implemented in Java Bytecode.</p>

CIDER connects to an <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a> server.</p>
<p>If you'd like to install and use CIDER, check out the <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/using-emacs-with-clojure/">Using Emacs with Clojure</a> chapter from <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Emacs with CIDER is the <strong>most popular IDE</strong> according to the <a href="http://cemerick.com/2013/11/18/results-of-the-2013-state-of-clojure-clojurescript-survey/">2013 State of Clojure Survey</a>. Bozhidar Batsov took over the project one year ago and CIDER has <strong>added many new features</strong>. I will enjoy hearing about all the things I don't use because I don't know about them.</p>

<h3 id="talk-generative-integration-teststalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ashton-kemerling">Generative Integration Tests</a></h3>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#ashton-kemerling">Ashton Kemerling's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about Generative Testing (also known as Property-based Testing) as applied to integration tests. Generative Testing is a methodology for generating many tests randomly to find failing cases (as opposed to writing each test by hand). It often <strong>finds difficult bugs</strong> and can present a very <strong>small, reproducible failing case</strong>.</p>
<p>The best talk I have seen about Generative Testing is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q">John Hughes' talk at Clojure/West</a>. John Hughes wrote Quickcheck for <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck1">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://www.quviq.com/">Erlang</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/reiddraper">Reid Draper</a> has recently ported it to Clojure in the form of <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check">test.check</a>. He also gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMhNINPo__g">a talk at Clojure/West about test.check</a>.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>Generative testing is great for unit testing. It has already found bugs in Clojure itself. What's not obvious is how to apply the technique to integration tests to test the interaction of different systems. This talk appears to be an <strong>experience report</strong> from a company that has actually used Generative Integration Tests.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://clojure-conj.org/speakers#anna-pawlicka">Anna Pawlicka's talk</a> at the <em>conj</em> is about <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolen</a>'s project, started in December of 2013. It's essentially a wrapper around Facebook's <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. It's a way to define HTML components functionally and has been making quite a splash.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtwq3QtddY">David Nolen's talk at Clojure/West</a> relates Om and React to the history of the GUI. It's the best high-level introduction I can imagine and discusses the ideas that motivated its design. If you watch one video to prepare for this talk, this should be it.</p>
<p>For a good talk about React itself, check out Pete Hunt's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3KksH8gfcQ">Be Predictable, Not Correct</a>. He's one of the main contributors to React and has been evangelizing it.</p>
<h5 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h5>
<p>React is significant because it is very different from other Javascript MVC frameworks. It takes a very functional approach instead of object oriented. React makes much easier to reason about the UI. Om has also made waves because <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/">David Nolen has shown</a> that using <strong>ClojureScript's immutable data structures with React can be faster than Backbone.js</strong> (a very popular library) even though immutable data is commonly considered slower than mutable data.</p>

<p>People have been asking me how they can get ready for all of the great talks lined up for <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a>. <strong>There are many topics, and people are feeling overwhelmed.</strong> They might know about some of the ideas, but not all of them.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to do just <strong>a little homework</strong> before the conj so that you would be sure to <strong>maximize your understanding</strong> and be able to participate in the conversations afterward?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, googling any topic reveals lots of material, and it's not always the best. <strong>It would take hours</strong> to sift through the background material for just one topic.</p>
<p>That's why I am publishing the Pre-conj Prep. Each day, I will send you <strong>one or two things to read or watch</strong> (whichever is better) to get up to speed on the topics of the talks (which are listed on the Clojure/conj speakers page). I'm used to finding great content for the Clojure Gazette, so you can be sure <strong>it will be helpful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conferences are ongoing conversations and explorations.</strong> Speakers discuss trends, best practices, and the future by drawing on the rich context built up in past conferences and other media. That rich context is what Pre-conj Prep is about. I want to enhance everyone's experience at the conj by surfacing that context. With just a little homework, we can be better prepared to <strong>understand and enjoy the talks and the hallway conversations</strong>.</p>
<p>There are 18 talks listed. After I go through all of them (that will take 18 days), I will go further than the published topics into other helpful stuff to get ready for a great <em>conj</em>. I am trying to get <strong>interviews with the speakers, restaurant/event/city guides, and more</strong>, to make the conference a special one.</p>

<p>The conj is a single-track conference, which means all talks happen in series in a single auditorium. The advantage of that is that <strong>everyone has a very similar experience</strong>. We all see the same talks (unless you skip one). The disadvantage is that you can't choose a different talk if you don't know about a topic. <strong>Preparation is key to having a great experience.</strong></p>
<p>As you probably know, conferences are social events. The talks are mostly an excuse to get together, meet each other, and talk about Clojure. The conversations that happen after a talk can be very rewarding. But if you don't understand why the topic is important, you may feel left out. Don't let that happen! <strong>You're travelling far and paying (or expensing) lots for the ticket, hotel, and travel.</strong> Make the most of it!</p>

<p>Summary: <em>ClojureScript adds a lot of value on top of the Javascript platform. But some of that value can be had directly in Javascript without using a new language.</em></p>
<p><strong>ClojureScript is a dialect of Clojure that compiles to Javascript.</strong> It lets you run Clojure in a browser or on Node. Just like Clojure, it has immutable data structures, literals for those data structures, macros, and core.async support.</p>
<p>These features are very powerful and they give ClojureScript a lot of power above Javascript. But a lot of that power can be had in Javascript through libraries, tools, and now some ES6 features. If you can't make the switch to ClojureScript, these tools might help you out. If you've heard of all the cool stuff that ClojureScript can do, well, this might be <strong>a good way to dip your toes in</strong> before you jump in.</p>
<h3 id="use-clojurescripts-awesome-data-structures-in-javascriptmori">1. <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/mori/">Use ClojureScript's awesome data structures in Javascript</a></h3>
<p>David Nolen, the maintainer of ClojureScript, has wrapped up the <strong>ClojureScript immutable data structures to be used as a Javascript library</strong> which he calls <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/mori/">mori</a>. He's put in a lot of work to make it convenient to use from Javascript. It's not just the datastructures. It also has all of the functional goodness that makes them powerful to use.</p>
<h3 id="write-csp-like-core.async-without-core.asynccsp">2. <a href="https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp">Write CSP like core.async without core.async</a></h3>
<p>CSP stands for Communicating Sequential Processes. It's a model of concurrency that is <strong>used in Go and in Clojure core.async</strong>. It's a powerful tool, especially in Javascript, where you don't have threads. Once you use it, you'll never go back.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to Generators in EcmaScript 6, <strong>you can write CSP code in Javascript</strong>. There's a library called <a href="https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp">js-csp</a> that does just that.</p>
<h3 id="better-data-formats-than-jsontransit">3. <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format">Better data formats than JSON</a></h3>
<p>JSON is a great format for data exchange, but <strong>it has limitations</strong>. One of the biggest limitations is that it is not extensible. You cannot define new types. Wouldn't it be nice to have values that get parsed as Javascript Date objects? Another limitation is that map keys can only be strings.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">edn format</a> is <strong>Clojure's literal syntax made into a data format</strong>. It includes many data structures, including symbols, keywords, sets, maps, lists, and vectors. It is also extensible with tagged literals, meaning a small tag can be placed in front of a value to indicate the semantic meaning of that value. There are a couple of built-in tags, such as #instant for Dates and #uuid for, yes, UUIDs. But the important thing is <strong>you can define your own and define how they get parsed</strong>.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/shaunxcode/jsedn">Javascript library</a> for parsing and generating edn.</p>
<p>edn is a great format, but parsing it in Javascript is never going to be as fast as parsing JSON. The JSON parser is written in C and highly optimized. Because of that limitation, the folks who build Clojure wrote <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format">Transit</a>, which is <strong>a data format that serializes to JSON</strong>. It's semantically equivalent to edn, so it's extensible, but it's also JSON, so it's fast to parse. There's a <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js">Javascript implementation</a>.</p>

<p>Macros are one of those legendary things Lisps are known for. They let you write code that writes code. Well, that's kind of a meaningless statement. Think of it more like extensible syntax. You can <strong>write a new type of syntax</strong> which will be <strong>translated to plain Javascript</strong>.</p>
<p>There's a macro system for Javascript called <a href="http://sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a>. The macro system is similar to the one found in Scheme systems. This isn't directly from Clojure, but you get the same power. <strong>Macros are a great way to extend a language.</strong> You no longer have to wait for a new language feature to be implemented. You can do it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Javascript community is active and growing. There are plenty of smart people making cool libraries that can revolutionize your programs. One of Clojure's philosophies is to have <strong>a small core language and extend</strong>, to the extent possible, using libraries<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. So, those libraries can often be leveraged outside of Clojure, which is true in the case of mori. Or they are simply standardized to work cross-platform, like edn and Transit. CSP and macros are simply powerful tools that can be added to many languages.</p>
<p><strong>Go give these tools a try.</strong> If you like them, you might like Clojure/ClojureScript. They will be here when you're ready. And when you <em>are</em> ready, I must recommend <a href="www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure</a>. It's a video course designed and produced to take you from zero to Clojure.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>Clojure has been successfully adopted by many companies. There are many resources available by people who did the hard work of introducing Clojure to their team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you want to get paid to write Clojure?</strong> Let's face it. Clojure is fun, productive, and more concise than many languages. And probably more concise than the one you're using at work, especially if you are working in a large company. You might code on Clojure at home. Or maybe you want to get started in Clojure but don't have time if it's not for work.</p>
<p>One way to get paid for doing Clojure is to <strong>introduce Clojure into your current job</strong>. I've compiled a bunch of resources for getting Clojure into your company.</p>
<p>Take these resources and do your homework. <strong>Bringing a new language into an existing company is not easy.</strong> I've summarized some of the points that stood out to me, but the resources are excellent so please have a look yourself.</p>
<h3 id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h3>
<p>Before you begin your quest to introduce Clojure, you're going to need a good strategy. By far the best presentation of a strategy is by Neal Ford. Neal Ford is a Director at ThoughtWorks and has a <strong>great strategy for introducing Clojure</strong> into an existing company. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WLgzCkhN2g">Watch this video</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Spread Clojure outside of the company.</li>
<li>Get a groundswell of people inside the company.</li>
<li>Use Clojure for things it's great at.</li>
<li>Get the Clojure jar file included.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your company happens to be using Ruby, Joshua Ballanco has some great tips for <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-rails-immutant">How to Sneak Clojure Into Your Rails Shop</a>.</p>
<p>Sean Corfield helped move a sizeable legacy application to Clojure. He's got some <a href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/clojure-in-the-enterprise/">good, sobering advice</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be ready to explain the lack of a framework.</li>
<li>OOP habits are ingrained.</li>
<li>Don't underestimate the difficulty.</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of great <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/01/lessons-learned-while-introducing-new.html">advice from someone who's actually done it</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find allies.</li>
<li>Answer the questions.</li>
<li>Take responsibility.</li>
<li>Get help.</li>
<li>Be an advocate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some <a href="https://vimeo.com/100485825">great advice from Logan Campbell</a>, someone who convinced his coworkers to use Clojure at a Post Office.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be positive: if they say &quot;We need static typing&quot;, say &quot;Great! Clojure has that!&quot; (which it does with Typed Clojure).</li>
<li>Show them working code.</li>
<li>Be ready for performance questions.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="material-for-other-developers">Material for other developers</h3>
<p><a href="http://getprismatic.com">Prismatic</a> has been using Clojure to great success. They've written about <a href="http://blog.getprismatic.com/om-sweet-om-high-functional-frontend-engineering-with-clojurescript-and-react/">how <strong>Clojure is used throughout their stack</strong></a>. This is a great introduction to answer the question &quot;Why Clojure?&quot;. Spread <a href="http://blog.getprismatic.com/om-sweet-om-high-functional-frontend-engineering-with-clojurescript-and-react/">this post</a> whenever anyone asks <em>why?</em>.</p>
<p>Leo Polovets polled Clojurists at Factual and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-would-someone-learn-Clojure">summarized their answers</a> to <strong><em>Why Clojure?</em></strong>.</p>
<p>A while ago, <a href="http://wit.io/posts/clojure-all-grown-up">this great post</a> was trending on Hacker News. It explains <strong><em>Why Clojure?</em></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="material-for-the-project-manager">Material for the project manager</h3>
<p>If you'd like a <strong>high-level overview of the business advantages to using Clojure</strong>, you can do a lot worse than asking Cognitect, the company that develops Clojure itself. They've published a <a href="http://cognitect.com/consulting/case-studies/roomkey">case study</a>, meant for non-tech folks, to understand the implications. It's focused mainly on Datomic, but it touches on Clojure.</p>
<p>Though a little hyperbolic, <a href="https://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/two-months-early/">this post</a> is <strong>a good one for the skeptical manager</strong>, the one who wonders whether their team can really learn a new technology quickly enough to justify the cost.</p>
<p>For those who <strong>like to follow industry trends</strong> and what others are recommending, look no further than the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. It's a compendium of recommendations, published regularly, that takes a <strong>realistic view of a constantly changing landscape</strong>. <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/clojure">Clojure has been rated at <em>Adopt</em> since October 2012</a>. A lot of secondary Clojure technologies are also on the radar, including <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/core-async">core.async</a>, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/om">om</a>, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/datomic">Datomic</a>, and <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a>.</p>
