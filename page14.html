<p>Summary: <em>I prefer to define Functional Programming as making a distinction between pure and impure code. With this definition, you can program functionally in any language. What differentiates the functional languages is how much help they give you to make the distinction.</em></p>
<p>There are a lot of conflicting definitions of Functional Programming out there. <strong>I'd like to share mine, which serves me well.</strong> It explains why Haskell is more functional than Scheme, and also how you can program functionally in a non-functional language like Java.</p>
<p><strong>Functional programming means programming with a distinction between pure code and impure code.</strong> Pure code has no side effects. It's referentially transparent. It means the same thing every time you run it. Impure code contains side effects, so running it twice is different from running it once.</p>
<p><strong>The distinction between pure code and impure code uniquely identifies functional programming and distinguishes it from other paradigms such as procedural and Object Oriented.</strong> Procedural is about modeling your solution as sequential steps. Object Oriented is about modeling your solution as communicating objects. Functional programming is about modeling your solution as pure functions.</p>
<p>Now, this definition is very practical. Notice that it's not about choice of language. <strong>You can write functional code in any language</strong>, just as you can code up an object system in C and say you're doing OO. The question is how much the language <em>helps</em> you write functional code or OO code.</p>
<p>On one extreme, you've got Haskell. There is no doubt that Haskell is a functional language. How does it help you write functional code? It has no mutable values and side-effects are confined to a single type: <code>IO</code>. <strong>The language forces you to make the distinction between pure and impure.</strong></p>
<p>On the other extreme, you've got machine code or assembly. At the lowest level, the language pushes you to avoid the distinction. <strong>All operations are about changing at least one location in memory.</strong> It could be a register or the top of the stack or something. But you are forced to change something. However, with a lot of super-human discipline, you could keep the distinction in your head. You might create a little heap and keep the discipline &quot;a procedure can only write to memory it allocates directly&quot;. And this way, you make a bit of room for some functional programming. <strong>But that language is not giving you any help.</strong></p>
<p>So why functional programming? Well, it turns out that knowing that running code twice will produce the same result makes it <strong>very easy to reason about</strong> it. And reasoning about code is basically our job as software engineers. What's more, the kind of reasoning you can do with functional programs can reach all the way up to the highest forms of reasoning, like math. That's where Haskell really shines. All of the category theory stuff (monads, functors, applicatives, etc) is an expression of that--mathematical concepts that are applicable in Haskell code.</p>
<p>That's it. That's my definition. The definition is <strong>inclusive yet gets at the essence</strong>. Functional Programming is a perspective that makes code easier to understand and maintain as it's being used in a system complex beyond your possible comprehension. And at its most sublime and abstract levels, Functional Programming approaches mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>If your functions return <code>core.async</code> channels instead of taking callbacks, you encourage them to be called within <code>go</code> blocks. Unchecked, this encouragement could proliferate your use of <code>go</code> blocks unnecessarily. There are some coding conventions that can minimize this problem.</em></p>
<p>I've been using (and enjoying!) <code>core.async</code> for about a year now (mostly in ClojureScript). It has been a huge help for <strong>easily building concurrency patterns</strong> that would be incredibly difficult to engineer (and maintain and change) without it.</p>
<p>Over that year, I've developed <strong>some practices for writing code with <code>core.async</code></strong>. I'm putting them here as an <a href="http://discuss.purelyfunctional.tv/t/core-async-code-styles/46">invitation for discussion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="use-callback-style-if-possible">Use callback style, if possible</h3>
<p>A style develops when using <code>core.async</code> where you convert what would in regular ClojureScript be a callback style with <em>return-a-channel</em> style. The channel will contain the result of the call when it is ready.</p>
<p>Using this style to keep you out of &quot;callback hell&quot; is overkill. &quot;Callback hell&quot; is not caused by a single callback. It is caused by the <strong>eternal damnation of coordinating multiple callbacks</strong> when they could be called in any order at any time. <strong>Callbacks invert control.</strong></p>
<p><code>core.async</code> quenches the hellfire because coordinating channels within a <code>go</code> block is easy. The <code>go</code> block decides which values to read in which order. <strong>Control is restored to the code in a procedural style.</strong></p>
<p>But return-a-channel style is not exactly free of sin. If you return a channel too much, <strong>the code that calls those functions will likely end up in a <code>go</code> block</strong>.</p>
<p><code>go</code> blocks will proliferate. <code>go</code> blocks incur extra cost, especially in ClojureScript where they happen asynchronously, meaning at the next iteration of the event loop, <strong>which is indeterminately far away</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>go</code> blocks might begin nesting (a function whose body is a <code>go</code> block is called by another function whose body is a <code>go</code> block, etc), which is correct semantically but <strong>probably won't give you the performance you're looking for</strong>. It's best to avoid it.</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; you say? The most important rule is to only use <code>core.async</code> in a particular function when necessary. If you can get by with just a callback, don't use <code>core.async</code>. <strong>Just use a callback.</strong> For instance, let's say you have an <code>ajax</code> function that takes a callback and you're trying to make a small API wrapper for convenience. You could make it return a channel like this:</p>
<pre><code>(defn search-google [query]
  (let [c (chan)]
    (ajax (str &quot;http://google.com/?q=&quot; query) #(put! c %))
    c))</code></pre>
<p>The interesting thing to note is that <code>core.async</code> is not being used very well above. Yes, you get rid of a callback, but <strong>there isn't much coordination happening</strong>, so it's not needed. It's best to keep it straightforward, like this:</p>
<pre><code>(defn search-google [query cb]
   (ajax (str &quot;http://gooogle.com/?q=&quot; query) cb))</code></pre>
<p>You're <strong>just doing one bit of work here</strong> (basically constructing a URL), which is a good sign. But how do you &quot;lift&quot; this into <code>core.async</code>?</p>
<h3 id="section"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code></h3>
<p>There's a common pattern in Javascript (not ubiquitous, but very common) to put the callback at the end of the parameter list. Since the callback is last, <strong>you can easily write something to add it automatically</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>(defn &lt;&lt;&lt; [f &amp; args]
  (let [c (chan)]
    (apply f (concat args [(fn [x]
                             (if (or (nil? x)
                                     (undefined? x))
                                   (close! c)
                                   (put! c x)))]))
    c))</code></pre>
<p>This little function is very handy. It automatically <strong>adds a callback to a parameter list</strong>. You call it like this:</p>
<pre><code>(go
  (js/console.log (&lt;! (&lt;&lt;&lt; search-google &quot;unicorn droppings&quot;))))</code></pre>
<p>This function lifts <code>search-google</code>, a regular asynchronous function written with callback style, into <code>core.async</code> return-a-channel style. With this function, <strong>if I always put the callback at the end, I can use my functions from within regular ClojureScript code and also from <code>core.async</code> code</strong>. I can also use any function (and there are many) that happen to have the callback last. This convention has two parts: <strong>always put the callback last and use <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> when you need it</strong>. With this function, I can reserve <code>core.async</code> for coordination (what it's good at), not merely simple asynchrony.</p>
<h3 id="convention"><code>&lt;convention</code></h3>
<p>There are times when writing a function using <code>go</code> blocks and returning channels <em>is</em> the best way. In those cases, I've adopted a naming convention. I <strong>put a <code>&lt;</code> prefix in front of functions that return channels</strong>. I tried it at the end of the name, but I like how it looks at the beginning.</p>
<pre><code>(go
  (js/console.log (&lt;! (&lt;do-something 1 2 3))))</code></pre>
<p>The left-arrow of <code>&lt;do-something</code> fits right into the <code>&lt;!</code>. It also visually matches <code>(&lt;&lt;&lt; do-something 1 2 3)</code>, so it <strong>makes correct code look correct and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html">wrong code look wrong</a></strong>. The naming convention extends to named values as well:</p>
<pre><code>(def &lt;values (chan))

(go
  (while true
    (js/console.log (inc (&lt;! &lt;values)))))</code></pre>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>These conventions are a great compromise between ease of using <code>core.async</code> (<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>) and universality (callbacks being universal in JS). The naming convention (<code>&lt;</code> prefix) visually marks code that should be used with <code>core.async</code>. These practices have taken me a long way. I'd love to discuss them with you <a href="http://discuss.purelyfunctional.tv/t/core-async-code-styles/46">here</a>.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>With a few functions from the standard library, Clojure lets you do most of what you want with regular expressions with no muss.</em></p>
<p><strong>Clojure is designed to be hosted.</strong> Instead of defining a standard Regular Expression semantics that works on all platforms, Clojure defers to the host's semantics. On the JVM, you're using Java regexes. In ClojureScript, it's Javascript regexes. That's the first thing to know.</p>
<p>Other than the semantics of the regexes themselves, <strong>the API is standardized across all platforms in the core library</strong>. And the syntax is convenient because you don't need to double escape your special characters.</p>
<h3 id="literal-representation">Literal representation</h3>
<p>Regexes can be constructed in Clojure using a <strong>literal syntax</strong>. Strings with a hash in front are interpreted as regexes.</p>
<pre><code>#&quot;regex&quot;</code></pre>
<p>On the JVM, the above line will create an instance of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html"><code>java.util.regex.Pattern</code></a>. In ClojureScript, it will create a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp"><code>RegExp</code></a>. Remember, the two regular expression languages are <strong>similar but different</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="matching-with-groups">Matching (with groups)</h3>
<p>There is a nice <strong>function that matches the whole string</strong>. It is called <a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/re-matches"><code>re-matches</code></a>. The return is a little complex. If the whole string does not match, it returns <code>nil</code>, which is nice because <code>nil</code> is falsey.</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (re-matches #&quot;abc&quot; &quot;zzzabcxxx&quot;)
   nil</code></pre>
<p>If the string does match, and there are no groups (parens) in the regex, then it returns the matched string.</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (re-matches #&quot;abc&quot; &quot;abc&quot;)
   &quot;abc&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If it matches but there are groups, then it returns a vector. The first element in the vector is the entire match. The remaining elements are the group matches.</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (re-matches #&quot;abc(.*)&quot; &quot;abcxyz&quot;)
   [&quot;abcxyz&quot; &quot;xyz&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>The three different return types can get tricky, but in general I do have groups, so it's either a vector or <code>nil</code>, which is easy to handle. You can even <strong>destructure it before you test it</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>(let [[_ fn ln] (re-matches #&quot;(\w+)\s(\w+)&quot; full-name)]
  (if fn ;; successful match
    (println fn ln)
    (println &quot;Unparsable name&quot;)))</code></pre>
<h3 id="matching-substrings">Matching substrings</h3>
<p><code>re-matches</code> matches the whole string. But often, we want to find a match within a string. <strong><a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/re-find"><code>re-find</code></a> returns the first match within the string.</strong> The return values are similar to <code>re-matches</code>.</p>
<h4 id="no-match-returns-nil">No match returns <code>nil</code></h4>
<pre><code>=&gt; (re-find #&quot;sss&quot; &quot;Loch Ness&quot;)
nil</code></pre>
<h4 id="match-without-groups-returns-matched-string">Match without groups returns matched string</h4>
<pre><code>=&gt; (re-find #&quot;s+&quot; &quot;dress&quot;)
&quot;ss&quot;</code></pre>
<h4 id="match-with-groups-returns-a-vector">Match with groups returns a vector</h4>
<pre><code>=&gt; (re-find #&quot;s+(.*)(s+)&quot; &quot;success&quot;)
   [&quot;success&quot; &quot;ucces&quot; &quot;s&quot;]</code></pre>
<h3 id="finding-all-substrings-that-match">Finding all substrings that match</h3>
<p>The last function from <code>clojure.core</code> I use a lot is <a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/re-seq"><code>re-seq</code></a>, which returns a <strong>lazy seq of all of the matches</strong>, not just the first. The elements of the seq are whatever type <code>re-find</code> would have returned.</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (re-seq #&quot;s+&quot; &quot;mississippi&quot;)
   (&quot;ss&quot; &quot;ss&quot;)</code></pre>
<h3 id="replacing-regex-matches-within-a-string">Replacing regex matches within a string</h3>
<p>Well, matching strings is cool, but often you'd like to <strong>replace a substring that matches with some other string</strong>. <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.string-api.html#clojure.string/replace"><code>clojure.string/replace</code></a> will replace all substring matches with a new string. Let's take a look:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (clojure.string/replace &quot;mississippi&quot; #&quot;i..&quot; &quot;obb&quot;)
   &quot;mobbobbobbi&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This function is actually <strong>quite versatile</strong>. You can <strong>refer directly to the groups</strong> in the replacement string:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (clojure.string/replace &quot;mississippi&quot; #&quot;(i)&quot; &quot;$1$1&quot;)
   &quot;miissiissiippii&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can also replace with the <strong>value of a function</strong> applied to the match:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (clojure.string/replace &quot;mississippi&quot; #&quot;(.)i(.)&quot;
     (fn [[_ b a]]
       (str (clojure.string/upper-case b)
            &quot;--&quot;
            (clojure.string/upper-case a))))
   &quot;M--SS--SS--Ppi&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can <strong>replace just the first occurence</strong> with <code>clojure.string/replace-first</code>.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-a-string-on-a-regex">Splitting a string on a regex</h3>
<p>Let's say you want to <strong>split a string on some character pattern</strong>, like one or more whitespace. You can use <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.string-api.html#clojure.string/split"><code>clojure.string/split</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (clojure.string/split &quot;This is a string    that I am splitting.&quot; #&quot;\s+&quot;)
   [&quot;This&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;string&quot; &quot;that&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;splitting.&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Nice!</p>
<h3 id="other-functions">Other functions</h3>
<p>Those are all of the functions I use routinely. There are some more, which are useful when you need them.</p>
<h4 id="re-patternre-pattern"><a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/re-pattern"><code>re-pattern</code></a></h4>
<p>Construct a regex from a <code>String</code>.</p>
<h4 id="re-matcherre-matcher"><a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/re-matcher"><code>re-matcher</code></a></h4>
<p>This one is not available in ClojureScript. On the JVM, it creates a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html"><code>java.util.regex.Matcher</code></a>, which is used for iterating over subsequent matches. This is not so useful since <code>re-seq</code> exists.</p>
<p>If you find yourself with a <code>Matcher</code>, you can call <code>re-find</code> on it to get the next match (instead of the first). You can also call <a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/re-groups"><code>re-groups</code></a> from the most recent match. Unless you need a <code>Matcher</code> for some Java API, just stick to <code>re-seq</code>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Well, that's regexes as I use them. They're super useful and easy to use in Clojure once you get the hang of them.</p>

              Warty Lists in Clojure
            </a>
          </h2>

          <div class="timestamp">

          </div>

          
<p>Summary: <em>Lists are kind of warty in Clojure. Care should be taken, especially by those coming from other Lisps.</em></p>
<p>One of the things that still trips me up in Clojure is the actual types of lists. I used to program in Common Lisp, where things are a bit easier to understand: something is either a list or an atom. Lists are built out of conses and end with <code>nil</code>. Everything else is an atom.</p>
<p>Coming from Common Lisp, one might expect this to work:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (listp (cons 1 nil))</code></pre>
<p>In CL, it will be true. In Clojure, it is also true. (Try it out yourself!) Launch a REPL. Go to <a href="http://tryclj.com/">Try Clojure</a>.</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (list? (cons 1 nil))</code></pre>
<p>What about this:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (list? (cons 1 (cons 1 nil)))</code></pre>
<p>We're consing onto a list, should be a list, no?</p>
<p>In Common Lisp, yes. In Clojure?</p>
<p>NO!</p>
<p>That's not a list. Go ahead, try it at your Clojure REPL.</p>
<p>What gives? How is that possible? Are we living in a Kafkaesque ECMAScript World?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/kafkaesque.png" />
</div>
<p>Well . . . probably.</p>
<p>What's going on? Put on your Indiana Jones fedora. We're going on an adventure deep into the heart of the Clojure JVM implementation.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders3.jpg" />
</div>
<p>First, how is <code>list?</code> defined?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/richhickey/clojure/blob/a1eff35124b923ef8539a35e7a292813ba54a0e0/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L4961">In clojure.core</a>:</p>
<pre><code>(defn list?
  &quot;Returns true if x implements IPersistentList&quot;
  {:added &quot;1.0&quot;}
  [x] (instance? clojure.lang.IPersistentList x))</code></pre>
<p>Great, <code>list?</code> is just an instance check. <strong>What classes implement <code>clojure.lang.IPersistentList</code>?</strong> According to the javadoc on the Clojure sources, there are two: <code>PersistentQueue</code> and <code>PersistentList</code>. There's also a static inner class in <code>PersistentList</code> called <code>EmptyList</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see those at the REPL:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (type ())
  clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList
=&gt; (list? ())
  true

=&gt; (type (list 1 2 3))
  clojure.lang.PersistentList
=&gt; (list? (list 1 2 3))
  true

=&gt; (type clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY)
  clojure.lang.PersistentQueue
=&gt; (list? clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY)
  true</code></pre>
<p>These all return true when given to <code>list?</code>. What about <code>(cons 1 nil)</code>?</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (type (cons 1 nil))
  clojure.lang.PersistentList
=&gt; (list? (cons 1 nil))
  true</code></pre>
<p>Great. <strong>Consing onto nil gives you a list</strong>. Let's cons onto a list:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (type (cons 0 (list 1 2 3)))
  clojure.lang.Cons
=&gt; (list? (cons 0 (list 1 2 3)))
  false</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders4.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Oh, no! Why does consing onto <code>nil</code> create a list, but <strong>consing onto a list create a cons</strong>? Poisonous dart averted! Back to the source code!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/richhickey/clojure/blob/a1eff35124b923ef8539a35e7a292813ba54a0e0/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L22">In clojure.core</a>:</p>
<pre><code>(def
 ^{:arglists &#39;([x seq])
    :doc &quot;Returns a new seq where x is the first element and seq is
    the rest.&quot;
   :added &quot;1.0&quot;}

 cons (fn* cons [x seq] (. clojure.lang.RT (cons x seq))))</code></pre>
<p>So it calls <code>clojure.lang.RT/cons</code>. We can <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/1.5.x/src/jvm/clojure/lang/RT.java#L565">look that up</a>:</p>
<pre><code>static public ISeq cons(Object x, Object coll){
    //ISeq y = seq(coll);
    if(coll == null)
        return new PersistentList(x);
    else if(coll instanceof ISeq)
        return new Cons(x, (ISeq) coll);
    else
        return new Cons(x, seq(coll));
}</code></pre>
<p>Wow! The code is clear: if the second argument is <code>null</code> (<code>nil</code>), <strong>it makes a <code>PersistentList</code></strong>. Otherwise, it constructs a <code>clojure.lang.Cons</code>, which is not a list! We're at the root of our wart, but there's nothing we can really do about it except keep exploring.</p>
<p>If I have a list (according to <code>list?</code>) and I want to add an element to the front to make a new list, how do I do that?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders%205.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Well, the answer is a little disappointing:</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (def ls (list 1 2 3))
=&gt; (def ls2 (conj ls 0))
=&gt; (list? ls2)
  true</code></pre>
<p><code>conj</code> will maintain the type, <code>cons</code> will not. What happens if I <code>conj</code> onto a <code>Cons</code>?</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; (def c (cons 1 (cons 2 nil)))
=&gt; (conj c 0)
  (0 1 2)
=&gt; (type (conj c 0))
  clojure.lang.Cons</code></pre>
<p>So, there you have it. It's a bit of a wart having all of these slightly different types and predicates like <code>list?</code> that slice them up in odd ways. Sometimes it's like running away from a giant paper-mache ball.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://lispcast.com/pictures/raiders6.jpg" />
</div>
<p>In Clojure's defense, I will say that <strong>I rarely use <code>list?</code></strong>, if at all. It's <strong>not a very useful function</strong> in <code>clojure.core</code>. I'm usually working at a much higher level than that, thinking in terms of sequences (an abstraction), not their concrete implementations. And in the end, you never get out of danger.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>Using LESS, we can almost achieve the expressive power of the Lambda Calculus as applied to styling. The expressive power is enough to create reusable styles applied to reusable HTML components.</em></p>
<p>Let's continue our exploration and analysis of <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/css-abstraction-combination">CSS</a> and <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/less-abstraction-combination">LESS</a>. This <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/keywords/functional-css/">series is about Functional CSS</a>. Our aim is to <strong>determine a good way to use HTML and CSS so that <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/separation-of-presentation-and-content">we can reuse both</a></strong>. We can't talk about &quot;Functional&quot; without talking about the Lambda Calculus.</p>
<p>The Lambda Calculus includes three things: <em>variables</em>, <em>abstractions</em>, and <em>applications</em>. Let's look at some Javascript.</p>
<pre><code>(function(x) { return x + x; })(10);</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, <code>x</code> is a variable, the function definition is a lambda abstraction, and calling the function (with the parens at the end) is called application. Luckily, <strong>Javascript gives us an additional kind of abstraction where we can name an expression</strong> to be reused:</p>
<pre><code>var f = function(x) { return x + x; };
f(10);</code></pre>
<p>We can name the function <code>f</code>, then apply it by referring to the name. What's more, we can <strong>compose them pretty well</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>var g = function(x) { return x * x; };
var h = function(x, y) { return g(x) + g(y); };
h(10, 20);</code></pre>
<p>We're composing function <code>g</code> by <em>applying</em> it inside of the definition of <code>h</code>. You're probably saying &quot;duh!&quot;--and rightly so. It's so common to do.</p>
<p>Which is why it's hard to understand why CSS does not include all of these parts. Let's at least <em>try</em> to <strong>decompose CSS into some parts</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>.some-class { width: 10px; height: 20px; }</code></pre>
<p>Here, we're <em>applying</em> the rule which contains two properties (<code>width</code> and <code>height</code>) to all of the elements that have the class <code>.some-class</code>. <code>.some-class</code> is the <em>argument</em> to the rule's application. In fake Javascript, it would look something like this<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<!-- -->

<pre><code>function(element) {
  element.width  = 10;
  element.height = 20;
}(document.getElementsByClassName(&#39;some-class&#39;));</code></pre>
<p>That is, we are <em>immediately</em> applying the abstraction to the argument. CSS has no way, as Javascript does, of <em>naming</em> the abstraction for use later. We definitely <em>want</em> that. What's more, <strong>there's no way to compose two rules together</strong>. In Javascript, we could refer to <code>g</code> within <code>h</code>. But in CSS, there's no way to do that.</p>
<p>LESS does have this ability. Since LESS is a superset of CSS, we can start with the above CSS code. Let's repeat it:</p>
<pre><code>.some-class { width: 10px; height: 20px; }</code></pre>
<p>Now we <em>abstract</em> it by naming it and then <em>apply</em> the name:</p>
<pre><code>.small-box() { width: 10px; height: 20px; }
.some-class { .small-box(); }</code></pre>
<p>That's somewhat better. We've got a reusable component (<code>.small-box</code>) and we've also added <strong>a bit more meaning to our code because we have a meaningful name</strong>. What's more, LESS lets you compose:</p>
<pre><code>.small-box() { width: 10px; height: 20px; }
.my-button() { .small-box(); border: 1px solid black; }

.some-class { .my-button(); }</code></pre>
<p>Here we've made an abstraction called <code>.my-button</code> by using <code>.small-box</code> inside. That's composition. And that's on par with our Javascript examples above.</p>
<p>There's one more thing that we might want that even Javascript doesn't have. Javascript has first-class functions. That's really nice. But there are many things in Javascript that are not first-class. For instance, the arithmetic operators (<code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>) cannot be passed to a function or assigned to variables. <strong>They are treated differently by the language.</strong> They are a bit like properties in CSS: all you can do with them is refer to them directly in an expression.</p>
<p>But what if Javascript did have first-class arithmetic functions? We can certainly fake them out.</p>
<pre><code>var plus  = function(a, b) { return a + b; };
var times = function(a, b) { return a * b; };
var minus = function(a, b) { return a - b; };
var over  = function(a, b) { return a / b; };</code></pre>
<p>Now we have functions that act just like the operators--and they're first-class. It's also way more consistent: every operator is a function.</p>
<p>We can do something similar in LESS. Imagine we took every property and did what I do to these:</p>
<pre><code>.width(@w)  { width:  @w; }
.height(@h) { height: @h; }
. . .</code></pre>
<p>Now we have the consistency that everything is at least referrable as a mixin. This is pretty good.</p>
<p>We can now define our styles--and name them--in this subset of LESS. <strong>Styles may reference other styles.</strong> And rules with selectors may reference styles. You could import pure styles from an external library, then refer to them in your rules, where you apply them to selectors. <strong>The HTML does not have to change, and neither do the styles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rules--where styles and selectors are tied together--will change the most.</strong> As common sets of styles are used together often, you might think about factoring them out into a new style, which would be added to your organization's standard style library. Also, as HTML components solidify, you could begin to firm up the class names and their structure, reusing them in a more permanent way. Yet, even though these two assets (the standard styles and the standard class names / HTML structures) are permanent, you can still change how they are styled by changing the rules. <strong>Both assets retain their value over time.</strong></p>
<h3 id="a-fly-in-the-ointment">A fly in the ointment</h3>
<p>Even though we have tremendous power over that given by CSS, <strong>we are not at the level of first-class styles</strong>. The following will NOT work in LESS, though we would expect it to.</p>
<pre><code>/* refer to variable like a mixin */
.apply(@style, @arg) { @style(@arg); }

.width(@w) { width: @w; }

/* pass in .width mixin */
#xyz { .apply(.width, 10px); }</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that <strong>you cannot use a mixin named with a variable</strong>. The same limitation exists in SCSS (SASS). The following is invalid.</p>
<pre><code>@mixin apply($s, $a) { @include $s($a); }</code></pre>
<p>Why can't a mixin be assigned to a variable? Mixins appear to be in a different namespace from variables, and only mixin syntax can appear in the mixin position. Though I don't think <code>apply</code> itself would be very useful, it would indicate a <strong>recursive abstraction power that could be used well</strong>.</p>
<p>Not being able to write <code>apply</code> hints that the developers of these two languages are thinking at the syntax level. They have added some great features, but <strong>they have not truly modeled the problem semantically</strong>. Instead, it feels like a mix of special-cased syntax rules and string interpolation. <a href="http://lesscss.org/features/#detached-rulesets-feature">You can assign a ruleset to a variable, but not a mixin?</a></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>LESS (and SASS, etc) have some very powerful features that are miles above CSS in terms of abstraction and composition. I hate using plain CSS after using LESS--LESS is just so much more expressive. You can do some impressive and useful things with them, and I continue to use them. I want to write about <strong>how I use a subset of LESS and a strict discipline in HTML to make styling easier and more maintainable</strong>. In addition, I'd like to <strong>explore what a better-designed style language might look like</strong>.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>One reason to separate style from content is to reuse HTML or CSS. Ultimately, we would like a solution where we can reuse both.</em></p>
<h3 id="reusable-content">Reusable Content</h3>
<p>There is an economic reason to separate presentation from content. Publishers have thousands of pages of HTML on their site, yet they want to enhance the style of their pages over time. It would <strong>cost a lot of money to change every single page to match their new style</strong>. So they invest a little more time writing each page so that the HTML markup does not refer to styles but to the semantics of the content (referred to as <em>semantic HTML</em>). Then they hire a designer to write CSS to make their existing content look new. The HTML is permanent and reusable, and the CSS is temporary and not-reusable. <strong>The separation is only one way: the HTML doesn't know the CSS, but the CSS does know the HTML.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, newspaper websites, blogs</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Semantic markup, CSS tailored to classes/structure of HTML</p>
<h3 id="reusable-styles">Reusable Styles</h3>
<p>Yet another economic reason is a relatively newer phenomenon. It has become very easy to create a new web site/application. Writing (or generating) lots of HTML is cheap, and it changes often during iterative development. What is <strong>relatively expensive is to <em>design</em> each of those pages each time the pages change</strong>. CSS is not good at adapting to page structure changes. So people have built CSS frameworks where the CSS is (relatively) permanent and the HTML is temporary. In these cases, <strong>the HTML knows the CSS, but the CSS doesn't know the HTML</strong>. The separation is again one way--this time the other way.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> HTML tailored to classes/structure of CSS, Reusable CSS</p>
<h3 id="reusable-content-and-styles">Reusable Content and Styles</h3>
<p>What if a newspaper site, with millions of existing HTML pages, could cheaply take advantage of the reusable styles of frameworks like Bootstrap? That is the Holy Grail of separation of concerns. What would be required to do that?</p>
<p><strong>What we really want is a two-way separation.</strong> We want HTML written in total isolation and CSS written in total isolation. We want permanent HTML and permanent CSS. How can the style and content, each developed separately, finally be brought together? The answer is simple: <strong>a third document to relate the two</strong>.</p>
<p>We have already seen that <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/css-abstraction-combination">CSS is not good at <em>abstraction</em></a>. CSS cannot name a style to use it later. However, <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/less-abstraction-combination">LESS does have powerful forms of abstraction</a>. LESS has the ability to <strong>define reusable styles and apply them to HTML</strong> that did not have those styles in mind. If you put the <em>definition of reusable styles</em> in one document and the <em>application of those styles</em> in another document, you achieve true separation. And it is already happening a little bit. <strong>You can do it in your own code.</strong></p>
<p>It is a bit like a software library. We put the reusable bits in the library, and their specific use in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, <a href="http://semantic.gs/">Semantic Grid System</a></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Semantic markup, Reuseable Styles, Tie-in document to relate Style to Content</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>CSS preprocessors, which began as convenience tools, are actually <strong>powerful enough to solve fundamental problems with HTML and CSS</strong>. While it is still early, LESS and other CSS preprocessors, if harnessed correctly, could dramatically transform how we build and design web sites. Typography, grids and layout, and other design concerns can be used as plugable libraries. And other languages that are specifically designed to do that may emerge. <strong>What would a systematic, analytical approach to such an approach look like?</strong></p>

<p>Summary: <em>Use the OWASP Top Ten Project to minimize security vulnerabilities in your Clojure web application.</em></p>
<p>Aaron Bedra gave a very damning talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBL59w7fXw4">the security of Clojure web applications</a>. He went so far as to say that Clojure web apps are some of the worst he has seen. You should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBL59w7fXw4">watch the talk</a>. He has some good recommendations.</p>
<p>One of the jobs of web frameworks is to handle security concerns inherent in the web itself. Because most Clojure programmers build their own web stack, they often <strong>fail to look at the security implications of their application</strong>. They do not protect their site from even the easiest and most common forms of vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are problems with the way the web works, not with the particular server technology, yet it has become the server's responsibility to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Luckily, <strong>the vulnerabilities are well-studied and there are known fixes</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</a> does a very good job of documenting common web vulnerabilities and providing good fixes for them. They have a project called the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=OWASP_Top_10_for_2013">Top Ten Project</a> which every web developer should refer to regularly and use to improve the security of their app. You should also run through the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/owasp-asvs/wiki/ASVS">Application Security Verification Standard</a> checklists to audit your code. <strong>But the Top Ten should get you to understand the basics.</strong></p>
<p>Warning: <em>I am not a security expert. You should do your own research. The code I present here is my own interpretation of the OWASP recommendations. It has not been audited by experts. Do your own research!</em></p>
<p>Also, security is an ongoing concern. <strong>If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions, please bring them up!</strong></p>
<p>Here is the Top Ten 2013 with a small breakdown and a Clojure solution, if applicable.</p>
<h3 id="a1.-injectiona1"><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection">A1. Injection</a></h3>
<p>If a server accepts input from the outside and then <strong>parses and interprets that input as a scripting or query language, it is open to attack</strong>. The most common form is SQL Injection, where an input form is posted to the server, the value of that form is concatenated into a string to make a SQL statement, and then the SQL statement is sent to the database to be executed. What happens if a malicious user types in <code>&quot;'; DELETE FROM USERS;&quot;</code>?</p>
<p>My preferred solution to SQL Injection in Clojure is to <strong>always use parameterized SQL statements</strong>. <code>clojure.java.jdbc</code>, supports these directly. <strong>The parameters will be escaped, making injection impossible.</strong></p>
<p>Another problem is if you want to read in some Clojure data from the client, and you call <code>clojure.core/read-string</code> on it. <strong><code>read-string</code> will execute arbitrary Java constructors.</strong> For instance:</p>
<pre><code>#java.io.FileWriter[&quot;myfile.txt&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>This will create the file <code>myfile.txt</code> or overwrite if it already exists. Also, there is a form (called read-eval form) to execute code at read-time:</p>
<pre><code>#=(println &quot;Hello, vulnerability!&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Read in that string, and it will print. Any code could be in there.</strong></p>
<p>The solution is to <strong>never use <code>clojure.core/read-string</code></strong>. Use <code>clojure.edn/read-string</code>, which is a well-documented format. It does not run arbitrary constructors. It has no read-eval forms.</p>
<p>Summary: <em>Always use parameterized SQL and use <code>clojure.edn/read-string</code> instead of <code>clojure.core/read-string</code> on edn input.</em></p>
<h3 id="a2-broken-authentication-and-session-managementa2"><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management">A2 Broken Authentication and Session Management</a></h3>
<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
<p>This is a big topic and I can't address it all here. Clojure has the <a href="https://github.com/cemerick/friend">Friend library</a>, which is the closest thing we have to a de facto standard. My suggestion is simply to <strong>read the entire Friend README</strong> and evaluate whether you should use it. This is serious stuff. Read it.</p>
<h4 id="session-management">Session Management</h4>
<p><strong>Ring provides a session system which is fairly good.</strong> It meets many of the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/owasp-asvs/wiki/Verification_V3">OWASP Application Security Verification Standard V3</a> requirements. But it does not handle all of them automatically. <strong>You still need code audits.</strong> For instance, if you are logging requests, OWASP recommends against logging the session key. You must ensure that the session key is added after the request is logged.</p>
<p>The ASVS also recommends expiring your sessions after inactivity and also after a fixed period, regardless of activity. Ring sessions do not do this automatically (the builtin mechanism has no notion of expiration) and the <strong>default implementations of session stores will store and accept sessions indefinitely</strong>. A simple middleware will do the trick of expiring them in both cases:</p>
<pre><code>(defn wrap-expire-sessions [hdlr &amp; [{:keys [inactive-timeout
                                            hard-timeout]
                                     :or {:inactive-timeout (* 1000 60 15)
                                          :hard-timeout (* 1000 60 60 2)}}]]
  (fn [req]
    (let [now (System/currentTimeMillis)
          session (:session req)
          session-key (:session/key req)]
      (if session-key ;; there is a session
        (let [{:keys [last-activity session-created]} session]
          (if (and last-activity
                   (&lt; (- now last-activity) inactive-timeout)
                   session-created
                   (&lt; (- now session-created) hard-timeout))
            (let [resp (hdlr req)]
              (if (:session resp)
                (-&gt; resp
                    (assoc-in [:session :last-activity] now)
                    (assoc-in [:session :session-created] session-created))
                resp))
            ;; expired session
            ;; block request and delete session
            {:body &quot;Your session has expired.&quot;
             :status 401
             :headers {}
             :session nil}))
        ;; no session, just call the handler
        ;; assume friend or other system will handle it
        (hdlr req)))))</code></pre>
<p>Set the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#HttpOnly_Attribute">HttpOnly attribute</a> on the session cookie. Very important for preventing stealing of session ids from XSS attacks.</p>
<p><em>Do not</em> set the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Domain_and_Path_Attributes">Domain attribute</a>, and <em>do</em> set the Path if you want something more restrictive than <code>/</code> (the Ring session default).</p>
<p><em>Do not</em> set the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Expire_and_Max-Age_Attributes">Expire and Max-Age</a> attributes. Setting them makes the browser store the session id on disk, which simply expands the number of ways an attacker can get ahold of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Session_ID_Name_Fingerprinting">Change the session cookie name to something utterly generic</a>, like &quot;id&quot;. You don't want to leak more information than necessary about how your sessions work.</p>
<p>Use HTTPS if you can and set the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Secure_Attribute">Secure</a> attribute of the cookie.</p>
<p>Do not use in-cookie sessions. In-memory are good but they can't scale past one machine. <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine"><code>carmine</code></a> has a redis-based session implementation.</p>
<p>Summary: <em>Here's how I use Ring sessions (with <code>carmine</code>) based on these OWASP recommendations.</em></p>
<pre><code>(session/wrap-session
   (wrap-expire-sessions
    handler
    {:inactive-timeout 500
     :hard-timeout 3000})
   {:cookie-name &quot;id&quot;

             {:expiration-secs (* 60 60 15)
             :key-prefix &quot;&quot;}) ;; leak nothing!

<p>Whenever text from one user is shown to another user, there is the potential for injecting code (HTML, JS, or CSS) that is run in the victim's browser. Imagine if Facebook allowed any HTML in the post submission form. A malicious user could add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with some keystroke logging code. <strong>Anybody who viewed that post in their feed would also get the key logger installed.</strong> That would be bad.</p>
<p>XSS is common because of how easy it is to make an app that stores user input (from a form post) in a database, then constructs the page out of stuff from the database. If you're not extremely careful, <strong>you could create a place where people can exploit each other</strong>.</p>
<p>The solution is to <strong>only use scrubbed or escaped values to build HTML pages</strong>. Because HTML pages can include different languages (HTML, CSS, JS), text needs to be scrubbed differently in each context. OWASP has a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet">set of rules to follow which will guarantee XSS prevention</a>.</p>
<p><code>hiccup.util/escape-html</code> (also aliased as <code>hiccup.core/h</code>) will escape all dangerous HTML characters into HTML entities. JS and CSS still need to be handled, and rules for HTML attributes need to be followed.</p>
<p>If you want to allow some HTML elements, you will need to do a complex scrub. Luckily, <strong>Google has a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/wiki/GettingStarted">nice Java library that sanitizes HTML</a></strong>. Use it.</p>
<p>Summary: <em>Validate and scrub input from the user and scrub/escape text on output.</em></p>

<p>This one is a biggie: <strong>each handler has to do authentication</strong>. Does the particular logged in user have access to the resources requested? There's no way to automate this with a middleware. But having <em>some</em> system is better than doing it ad hoc each time. Remember: an attacker can construct any URL, including URLs with a database key in it. Don't assume that just because a request contains a key, the user must have the rights to it.</p>
<p>Summary: <em>Always check the authority of the requesting session before performing an action.</em></p>

<p>Let's imagine you have a bank account at Bank of Merica. You just checked your balance and didn't log out. Then you go to some public forum, where someone has posted a cool file. There's a big download button. You click it, and the next thing you know, you're on your bank page and all of your money has been transfered out of your account.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>The download button said &quot;Download&quot; but <strong>it was really a form submit button</strong>. The form had hidden fields &quot;to-account&quot;, and &quot;amount&quot;. The action of the form was &quot;http://www.bankofmerica.com/transfer-money&quot;. By clicking that button, <strong>the form was posted to the bank, and because you were just logged in, oops, it transfered all your money away</strong>.</p>
<p>The solution is that you only want to <strong>accept form posts that come directly from your site</strong>, which you control. You don't want some random person to convince people to click on other sites to be able to transfer people's money like that.</p>
<p>There are several possible solutions. One approach is to add a secret to the session and also insert that secret into every form. That is the approach taken by the <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/ring-anti-forgery">ring-anti-forgery</a> library.</p>
<p>The solution that I like is to do a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Double_Submit_Cookies">double-submit</a>. This means you submit a secret token in the cookie (sent with each web request) and in a hidden field in the form. The server confirms that the cookie and the hidden field match. But the hidden field in the form is added by a small Javascript script which reads it from the cookie. <strong>Browsers don't allow Javascript to read cookies from other sites, so you guarantee that they form was posted from your site.</strong></p>
<p>There are three parts to the solution.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install a secret token as a cookie.</li>
<li>Install a script to add the hidden field to all forms.</li>
<li>Check that the field matches the cookie on POSTs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is some code to do 1 and 3.</p>
<pre><code>(defn is-form-post? [req]
  (and (= :post (:request-method req))
       (let [ct (get-in req [:headers &quot;content-type&quot;])]
         (or (= &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; ct)
             (= &quot;multipart/form-data&quot; ct)))))

(defn csrf-tokens-match? [req]
  (let [cookie-token (get-in req [:cookies &quot;csrf&quot;])
        post-token   (get-in req [:form-params &quot;csrf&quot;])]
    (= cookie-token post-token)))

(defn wrap-csrf-cookie [hdlr]
  (fn [req]
    (let [cookie (get-in req [:cookies &quot;csrf&quot;]
                         (str (java.util.UUID/randomUUID)))]
      (assoc-in (hdlr req) [:cookies &quot;csrf&quot;] cookie))))

(defn wrap-check-csrf [hdlr]
  (fn [req]
    (if (is-form-post? req)
      (if (csrf-tokens-match? req)
        ;; we&#39;re safe
        (hdlr req)
        ;; possible attack
        {:body &quot;CSRF tokens don&#39;t match.&quot;
         :status 400
         :headers {}})
      ;; we don&#39;t check other requests
      (hdlr req))))</code></pre>
<p>The Javascript should be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>(def csrf-script &quot;(function() {
  var cookies = document.cookie;
  var matches = cookies.match(/csrf=([^;]*);/);
  var token   = matches[1];
  $(&#39;form&#39;).each(function(i, form) {
    if(form.attr(&#39;method&#39;).toLowerCase() === &#39;post&#39;) {
      var hidden = $(&#39;&lt;input /&gt;&#39;);
      hidden.attr(&#39;type&#39;, &#39;hidden&#39;);
      hidden.attr(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;csrf&#39;);
      hidden.attr(&#39;value&#39;, token);
      form.append(hidden);
    }
  })
}());&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You should add it to all HTML pages. Note that this example script requires jQuery. Put it right before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[:script csrf-script]</code></pre>
<p>The nice thing about this solution is that it is <strong>strict by default</strong>. If you don't include the script, form posts won't work (assuming <code>wrap-check-csrf</code> is in your middleware stack).</p>
<p>Summary: <em>CSRF attacks take advantage of properties of the browser (instead of properties of your server), so their defense can largely be automated.</em></p>

<p>One common pattern for login workflow is to have a query parameter that contains the url to redirect to. Since it's a user parameter, <strong>it's open to the world and could be a doorway for attackers</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, let's say someone sends an email to someone asking them to log in to their bank account. In it, there's this link:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.bankofmerica.com/login?redirect=http://attackersite.com</code></pre>
<p>What happens when they click? They see the legitimate site of their bank, which they trust. But it redirects them to the attacker's site, which has been designed to look like the bank site. <strong>The user might miss this change of domains and unwittingly reveal private information.</strong></p>
<p>What can you do?</p>
<p>OWASP recommends never performing redirects, which is impractical. The next best thing is to never base the redirect on a user parameter. This would work, but puts a lot of trust in the developers and security auditors to check that the policy is enforced. <strong>My preferred solution allows redirects that conform to a whitelist of patterns.</strong></p>
<pre><code>(def redirect-whitelist
  [#&quot;https://www.bankofmerica.com/&quot; ;; homepage
   #&quot;https://www.bankofmerica.com/account&quot; ;; account page
   ...
  ])

(defn wrap-authorized-redirects [hdlr]
  (fn [req]
    (let [resp (hdlr req)
          loc (get-in resp [:headers &quot;Location&quot;])]
      (if loc
        (if (some #(re-matches % loc) redirect-whitelist)
          ;; redirect on our whitelist, it&#39;s ok!
          resp
          ;; possible attack
          (do
            ;; log it
            (warning &quot;Possible redirect attack: &quot; loc)
            ;; change redirect back to home page
            (assoc-in resp [:headers &quot;Location&quot;] &quot;https://www.bankofmerica.com/&quot;)))
        resp))))</code></pre>
<p>Summary: <em>Redirect attacks can largely be avoided by checking the redirect URL against a whitelist.</em></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Web security is hard. It takes education and vigilance to keep our servers secure. Luckily, the main security flaws of the web are well-understood and well-documented. However, this is only half of the work. These need to be translated into Clojure either as libraries and simply as &quot;best practices&quot;. Further, these libraries and practices need to be discussed and kept top-of-mind.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>The Ring SPEC is the core of the Clojure web ecosystem. The standard is small and <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/web-dev-in-clojure#subscribe">a reference</a> is handy.</em></p>
<p>If you program the web in Clojure, you probably use Ring. Even if you don't, your server is likely <a href="http://http-kit.org/">Ring compatible</a>.</p>
<p>Ring has a small SPEC. It's centered around defining the keys one can expect in the request and response maps. And the exact names for keywords are easy to forget.</p>
<p>I don't want to forget. I use Ring often enough that I want a quick reference. A while ago, I printed out a quick summary of the keys for the request and response maps and hung it on the wall behind my monitor. I refer to it frequently.</p>
<p>If you program the web in Clojure, you might appreciate this printout. If you're learning, it could be an invaluable reference. <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/web-dev-in-clojure#subscribe">Please download the PDF.</a></p>

              What Web Framework Should I Use in Clojure?

<p>Summary: <em>There are a number of web frameworks in Clojure, but beginners should roll their own server stack themselves to tap into the Ring ecosystem.</em></p>
<p>One question that I am asked a lot by beginners in Clojure is <strong>&quot;What web framework should I use?&quot;</strong> This is a good question. In Python, there's Django. In PHP, Drupal. And of course in Ruby, there's the king of all web frameworks, Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>What framework should you use in Clojure? The question is actually kind of hard to answer. There are a number of web frameworks out there. Some people call <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> a framework, though it is really a library. <a href="https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir">lib-noir</a> does a lot of work for you. Then there's your true frameworks, like <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal">Pedestal</a> or <a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a>, which provide infrastructure and abstractions for tackling web development. All of these projects are great, but for a beginner, <strong>I have to recommend building your own web stack starting with Ring</strong>.</p>
<p>Compojure is really just a routing library, not a framework. You can use it for your routing needs, though there are alternatives, such as <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/playnice">playnice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/juxt/bidi">bidi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clojurewerkz/route-one">Route One</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thatismatt/gudu">gudu</a>. <strong>If you don't want to decide, use Compojure. It's widely used and works great.</strong> If you want to go in depth, read the docs for the others. They are each good for different cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir">lib-noir</a> comes from <a href="http://www.webnoir.org/">Noir</a>, which was a web framework (now deprecated). It was easy and provided a bit of plumbing already built for you, so you could just start a project with a lot of the infrastructure built in. lib-noir is that infrastructure in library form. I haven't used it, but a lot of people like it. However, when I look at it, I see that <strong>most of what it provides I either won't use or it is trivial to add myself</strong>. That would normally be ok if there was huge adoption for it (like with Rails) so you get an ecosystem effect, but there isn't. <strong>lib-noir is used but certainly not dominant.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal">Pedestal</a> has a lot of backing. It aims to tackle single-page apps by providing a sane front-end environment using ClojureScript in the form of a message queue. If you're into &quot;real-time apps&quot;, this may be for you. Though, I would caution you that it's not for a Clojure beginner. <strong>Pedestal introduces a lot of new concepts that even experienced Clojure programmers have to learn.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/app-tutorial/wiki">tutorial</a> is long and arduous. You will have problems learning Pedestal without knowing Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pedestal-users/jODwmJUIUcg">Pedestal has changed dramatically</a> since I last looked at it. It is no longer a frontend framework. It is now a high-performance backend server for high performance asynchronous processing. It's worth looking at if you need that. Otherwise, I stick with my recommendation to use basic Ring.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a> is also designed for web apps. It gives you a DOM written in ClojureScript (including custom components), dataflow programming (like a spreadsheet), and client-server communication. It's a bold step, but again, <strong>requires you to buy into programming models that will take a long time to understand</strong>. If you are not already familiar with Clojure, you are asking for trouble.</p>
<p>There are other frameworks out there. But I recommend rolling your own stack. If you're learning Clojure, <strong>the best way to grasp how web apps work is to get a <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> Jetty adapter set up with some basic handlers</strong>. Add existing middleware as you need it. Write some middleware of your own. Use Compojure to route. Use <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a> to generate HTML. <strong>That setup will get you a long way.</strong></p>
<p>Ring is just functions. With a few basic concepts and a copy of the Ring SPEC handy, you can build a web server very quickly that does exactly what you want and <strong>you can understand every aspect of it</strong>. The experience of building one yourself can teach you a lot about how the other frameworks are put together.</p>
<p>What's more, Ring <em>is</em> dominant. Most people write functionality (in the form of middleware and handlers) assuming Ring and no more. So by staying close to the metal, you are <strong>tapping into a huge resevoir of pre-written libraries that are all compatible with each other</strong>. Ring is the locus for the Clojure web ecosystem.</p>
<p>Wiring up your own middleware stack is not that daunting. If you want guidance, <strong>my <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/web-dev-in-clojure">Web Development in Clojure video series</a> is now for sale</strong>. It starts with a brand new Clojure project and ends with a fully functional app, backed by a database, and hosted on Heroku (for free!). In one hour, <strong>it explains all the concepts and shows you lots of examples</strong>. There's lots of exercises to get your brain whirring.</p>
<p>Recommended stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> (with Jetty adapter)
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.params.html#var-wrap-params">wrap-params</a> (parsing params)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/ring-devel/src/ring/middleware/reload.clj">wrap-reload</a> (for development)</li>
<li><a href="http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.resource.html#var-wrap-resource">wrap-resource</a> and <a href="http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.file-info.html#var-wrap-file-info">wrap-file-info</a> (static files)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then keep adding and customizing.</p>

              When To Use a Macro in Clojure

<p>Summary: <em>Macros should be avoided to the extent possible. There are three circumstances where they are required.</em></p>
<p>There's a common theme in Lisp that you should only use macros when you need them. <strong>It is very common to see a new lisper overuse macros.</strong> I did it myself when I first learned Lisp. They are very powerful and make you the king of syntax.</p>
<p>Clojure macros do have their uses, but why should you avoid them if possible? The principle reason is that <strong>macros are not first-class in Clojure</strong>. You cannot access them at runtime. You cannot pass them as an argument to a function, nor do any of the other powerful stuff you've come to love from functional programming. In short, <strong>macros are not functional programming</strong> (though they can make use of it).</p>
<p>A function, on the other hand, is a first-class value, and so is available for awesome functional programming constructs. <strong>You should prefer functions to macros.</strong></p>
<p>That said, macros are still useful because there are things macros can do that functions cannot. <strong>What are the powers of a macro that are unavailable to any other construct in Clojure?</strong> If you <em>need</em> any of these abilities, write a macro.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-has-to-run-at-compile-time">1. The code has to run at compile time</h3>
<p>There are just some things that need to happen at compile time. I recently wrote a macro that returns the hash of the current git commit so that the hash can be embedded in the ClojureScript compilation. This needs to be done at compile time because the script will be run somewhere else, where it cannot get the commit hash. Another example is <strong>performing expensive calculations at compile time as an optimization</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro build-time []
  (str (java.util.Date.)))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>build-time</code> macro returns a String representation of the time it is run.</p>
<p><strong>Running code at compile time is not possible in anything other than macros.</strong></p>
<h3 id="you-need-access-to-unevaled-arguments">2. You need access to unevaled arguments</h3>
<p>Macros are useful for writing <strong>new, convenient syntactic constructs</strong>. And when we talk about syntax, we are typically talking about raw, <strong>unevaluated sexpressions</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro when
  &quot;Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do.&quot;
  {:added &quot;1.0&quot;}
  [test &amp; body]
  (list &#39;if test (cons &#39;do body)))</code></pre>
<p><code>clojure.core/when</code> is a syntactic sugar macro which transforms into an <code>if</code> with a <code>do</code> for a <em>then</em> and no <em>else</em>. The <code>body</code> should not be evaled before the <code>test</code> is checked.</p>
<p>Getting access to the unevaluated arguments is available by quoting (<code>'</code> or <code>(quote ...)</code>), but that is <strong>often unacceptable for syntactic constructs</strong>. Macros are the only way to do that.</p>
<h3 id="you-need-to-emit-inline-code">3. You need to emit inline code</h3>
<p>Sometimes calling a function is unacceptable. That call is either too expensive or is otherwise not the behavior you want.</p>
<p>For instance, in Javascript in the browser, you can call <code>console.log('msg')</code> to print out a message and the line number to the console. In ClojureScript, this becomes something like this: <code>(.log js/console &quot;msg&quot;)</code>. Not convenient at all. <strong>My first thought was to create a function.</strong><sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>(defn log [msg]
  (.log js/console msg))</code></pre>
<p>This worked alright for printing the message, but the line numbers were all pointing to the same line: the body of the function! <code>console.log</code> records the line exactly where it is called, so <strong>it needs to be inline</strong>. I replaced it with a macro, which highlights its purpose as syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro log [msg]
  `(.log js/console ~msg))</code></pre>
<p>The body replaces the call to log, so <strong>it is located where it is needed for the proper behavior.</strong></p>
<p>If you need <strong>inline code</strong>, a macro is the only way.</p>
<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p>Of course, <strong>any combination of these is also acceptable</strong>. And don't forget that although you might need a macro, macros are only available at compile time. So you should consider <strong>providing a function that does the same thing</strong> and then wrap it with a macro.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Macros are very powerful. Their power comes with a price: they are only available at compile time. Because of that, functions should be preferred to macros. The use of macros should be reserved for those special occasions when their power is needed.</p>
