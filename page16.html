<p>Summary: <em>There are a number of web frameworks in Clojure, but beginners should roll their own server stack themselves to tap into the Ring ecosystem.</em></p>
<p>One question that I am asked a lot by beginners in Clojure is <strong>&quot;What web framework should I use?&quot;</strong> This is a good question. In Python, there's Django. In PHP, Drupal. And of course in Ruby, there's the king of all web frameworks, Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>What framework should you use in Clojure? The question is actually kind of hard to answer. There are a number of web frameworks out there. Some people call <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> a framework, though it is really a library. <a href="https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir">lib-noir</a> does a lot of work for you. Then there's your true frameworks, like <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal">Pedestal</a> or <a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a>, which provide infrastructure and abstractions for tackling web development. All of these projects are great, but for a beginner, <strong>I have to recommend building your own web stack starting with Ring</strong>.</p>
<p>Compojure is really just a routing library, not a framework. You can use it for your routing needs, though there are alternatives, such as <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/playnice">playnice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/juxt/bidi">bidi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clojurewerkz/route-one">Route One</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thatismatt/gudu">gudu</a>. <strong>If you don't want to decide, use Compojure. It's widely used and works great.</strong> If you want to go in depth, read the docs for the others. They are each good for different cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir">lib-noir</a> comes from <a href="http://www.webnoir.org/">Noir</a>, which was a web framework (now deprecated). It was easy and provided a bit of plumbing already built for you, so you could just start a project with a lot of the infrastructure built in. lib-noir is that infrastructure in library form. I haven't used it, but a lot of people like it. However, when I look at it, I see that <strong>most of what it provides I either won't use or it is trivial to add myself</strong>. That would normally be ok if there was huge adoption for it (like with Rails) so you get an ecosystem effect, but there isn't. <strong>lib-noir is used but certainly not dominant.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal">Pedestal</a> has a lot of backing. It aims to tackle single-page apps by providing a sane front-end environment using ClojureScript in the form of a message queue. If you're into &quot;real-time apps&quot;, this may be for you. Though, I would caution you that it's not for a Clojure beginner. <strong>Pedestal introduces a lot of new concepts that even experienced Clojure programmers have to learn.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/app-tutorial/wiki">tutorial</a> is long and arduous. You will have problems learning Pedestal without knowing Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pedestal-users/jODwmJUIUcg">Pedestal has changed dramatically</a> since I last looked at it. It is no longer a frontend framework. It is now a high-performance backend server for high performance asynchronous processing. It's worth looking at if you need that. Otherwise, I stick with my recommendation to use basic Ring.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a> is also designed for web apps. It gives you a DOM written in ClojureScript (including custom components), dataflow programming (like a spreadsheet), and client-server communication. It's a bold step, but again, <strong>requires you to buy into programming models that will take a long time to understand</strong>. If you are not already familiar with Clojure, you are asking for trouble.</p>
<p>There are other frameworks out there. But I recommend rolling your own stack. If you're learning Clojure, <strong>the best way to grasp how web apps work is to get a <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> Jetty adapter set up with some basic handlers</strong>. Add existing middleware as you need it. Write some middleware of your own. Use Compojure to route. Use <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a> to generate HTML. <strong>That setup will get you a long way.</strong></p>
<p>Ring is just functions. With a few basic concepts and a copy of the Ring SPEC handy, you can build a web server very quickly that does exactly what you want and <strong>you can understand every aspect of it</strong>. The experience of building one yourself can teach you a lot about how the other frameworks are put together.</p>
<p>What's more, Ring <em>is</em> dominant. Most people write functionality (in the form of middleware and handlers) assuming Ring and no more. So by staying close to the metal, you are <strong>tapping into a huge resevoir of pre-written libraries that are all compatible with each other</strong>. Ring is the locus for the Clojure web ecosystem.</p>
<p>Wiring up your own middleware stack is not that daunting. If you want guidance, <strong>my <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/web-dev-in-clojure">Web Development in Clojure video series</a> is now for sale</strong>. It starts with a brand new Clojure project and ends with a fully functional app, backed by a database, and hosted on Heroku (for free!). In one hour, <strong>it explains all the concepts and shows you lots of examples</strong>. There's lots of exercises to get your brain whirring.</p>
<p>Recommended stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> (with Jetty adapter)
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.params.html#var-wrap-params">wrap-params</a> (parsing params)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/ring-devel/src/ring/middleware/reload.clj">wrap-reload</a> (for development)</li>
<li><a href="http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.resource.html#var-wrap-resource">wrap-resource</a> and <a href="http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.file-info.html#var-wrap-file-info">wrap-file-info</a> (static files)</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then keep adding and customizing.</p>

              When To Use a Macro in Clojure

<p>Summary: <em>Macros should be avoided to the extent possible. There are three circumstances where they are required.</em></p>
<p>There's a common theme in Lisp that you should only use macros when you need them. <strong>It is very common to see a new lisper overuse macros.</strong> I did it myself when I first learned Lisp. They are very powerful and make you the king of syntax.</p>
<p>Clojure macros do have their uses, but why should you avoid them if possible? The principle reason is that <strong>macros are not first-class in Clojure</strong>. You cannot access them at runtime. You cannot pass them as an argument to a function, nor do any of the other powerful stuff you've come to love from functional programming. In short, <strong>macros are not functional programming</strong> (though they can make use of it).</p>
<p>A function, on the other hand, is a first-class value, and so is available for awesome functional programming constructs. <strong>You should prefer functions to macros.</strong></p>
<p>That said, macros are still useful because there are things macros can do that functions cannot. <strong>What are the powers of a macro that are unavailable to any other construct in Clojure?</strong> If you <em>need</em> any of these abilities, write a macro.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-has-to-run-at-compile-time">1. The code has to run at compile time</h3>
<p>There are just some things that need to happen at compile time. I recently wrote a macro that returns the hash of the current git commit so that the hash can be embedded in the ClojureScript compilation. This needs to be done at compile time because the script will be run somewhere else, where it cannot get the commit hash. Another example is <strong>performing expensive calculations at compile time as an optimization</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro build-time []
  (str (java.util.Date.)))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>build-time</code> macro returns a String representation of the time it is run.</p>
<p><strong>Running code at compile time is not possible in anything other than macros.</strong></p>
<h3 id="you-need-access-to-unevaled-arguments">2. You need access to unevaled arguments</h3>
<p>Macros are useful for writing <strong>new, convenient syntactic constructs</strong>. And when we talk about syntax, we are typically talking about raw, <strong>unevaluated sexpressions</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro when
  &quot;Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do.&quot;
  {:added &quot;1.0&quot;}
  [test &amp; body]
  (list &#39;if test (cons &#39;do body)))</code></pre>
<p><code>clojure.core/when</code> is a syntactic sugar macro which transforms into an <code>if</code> with a <code>do</code> for a <em>then</em> and no <em>else</em>. The <code>body</code> should not be evaled before the <code>test</code> is checked.</p>
<p>Getting access to the unevaluated arguments is available by quoting (<code>'</code> or <code>(quote ...)</code>), but that is <strong>often unacceptable for syntactic constructs</strong>. Macros are the only way to do that.</p>
<h3 id="you-need-to-emit-inline-code">3. You need to emit inline code</h3>
<p>Sometimes calling a function is unacceptable. That call is either too expensive or is otherwise not the behavior you want.</p>
<p>For instance, in Javascript in the browser, you can call <code>console.log('msg')</code> to print out a message and the line number to the console. In ClojureScript, this becomes something like this: <code>(.log js/console &quot;msg&quot;)</code>. Not convenient at all. <strong>My first thought was to create a function.</strong><sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>(defn log [msg]
  (.log js/console msg))</code></pre>
<p>This worked alright for printing the message, but the line numbers were all pointing to the same line: the body of the function! <code>console.log</code> records the line exactly where it is called, so <strong>it needs to be inline</strong>. I replaced it with a macro, which highlights its purpose as syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro log [msg]
  `(.log js/console ~msg))</code></pre>
<p>The body replaces the call to log, so <strong>it is located where it is needed for the proper behavior.</strong></p>
<p>If you need <strong>inline code</strong>, a macro is the only way.</p>
<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p>Of course, <strong>any combination of these is also acceptable</strong>. And don't forget that although you might need a macro, macros are only available at compile time. So you should consider <strong>providing a function that does the same thing</strong> and then wrap it with a macro.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Macros are very powerful. Their power comes with a price: they are only available at compile time. Because of that, functions should be preferred to macros. The use of macros should be reserved for those special occasions when their power is needed.</p>

              LESS has Better Forms of Abstraction than CSS
            </a>
          </h2>

<p>Summary: <em>LESS has obviously better forms of abstraction and combination than CSS. It has recursive style definitions, which is enough to consider it a &quot;powerful language&quot;.</em></p>
<p>Ok, it's obvious that <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/css-abstraction-combination">CSS has weak forms of combination and abstraction</a>. But now we have a good framework for understanding <em>why</em>. &quot;CSS Preprocessors&quot;, as they are called, are getting really popular now. We would be smart to <strong>analyze LESS in the same way that we analyzed CSS</strong>, if only to temper the glamor of trendiness that surrounds it. <a href="http://twitter.com/ericnormand">Comments are welcome.</a></p>
<p>Because LESS aims to be a superset of CSS, it has all of <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/css-abstraction-combination">the primitive expressions, means of combination, and means of abstraction that come baked into CSS</a>. I already went over those last time, so I will not go over them again. <strong>So what things are added by LESS?</strong></p>
<h3 id="primitive-expressions">Primitive Expressions</h3>
<p>Besides existing CSS properties, <strong>LESS adds two new primitive expressions.</strong> <em>Mixin application</em> (<code>.rounded-corners(10px);</code>) in a rule <strong>recursively applies the primitive expressions defined in the body of the mixin to the current rule</strong>. Mixin applications can be parameterized with value expressions, or they can have no parameters. <em>Extension</em> (<code>&amp;:extend(.blue-button);</code>) is similar, but instead of applying the primitive expressions to a rule body, it adds the selector of the rule to the rule selector of the extension. <strong>Extension is recursive as well.</strong></p>
<p>Variables and mathematical expressions change the way primitive properties work. In CSS, primitive properties were comprised of a property name and a literal property value. In LESS, variables and math expressions, as well as literal values, can be in the value place (right hand side) of a property.</p>
<p>Variables can also be used in selectors.</p>
<h3 id="means-of-combination">Means of Combination</h3>
<p><strong>The principle means of combination are still the rule</strong>, but add to it the <strong>ability to nest rules</strong>, and things are more interesting. Nesting two rules is shorthand for writing out two rules (unnested) with a nested selector. While in the simple case it is simply a shorthand, <strong>when nested rules are applied as mixins, you gain a lot more than better syntax</strong>. Mixins with nested subrules allows you to <em>name</em> a nesting and refer to it later.</p>
<h3 id="means-of-abstraction">Means of Abstraction</h3>
<p>CSS did not contain much in the way of abstraction. <strong>LESS focuses primarily in the realm of abstraction</strong>, probably to appease the will to power of front-end designers. <em>Variables</em> allow property values to be named, and naming is a form of abstraction. <strong>Variables are a good way to name values that all have the same meaning and would therefore change at the same time.</strong> For instance, a shade of green that is used throughout the styles is a perfect use for variables. Variables can be used in a similar way to name selectors.</p>
<p>A more powerful form of abstraction comes from the ability to define mixins, apply mixins, and use of <code>:extend()</code>. In LESS, any rule using a single class or id selector can be used as a mixin. This is essentially <strong>a way to name a rule</strong>--our principle form of combination. In addition, if you put empty parentheses after the class selector in the rule, the rule is not outputted into the generated CSS, which can save bytes. Mixins can also have parameters (scoped variables), so they can be <strong>abstracted over a variety of values</strong>. Extend allows a similar kind of abstraction which promises to be more efficient.</p>
<p>Mixins are very powerful. In fact, <strong>this is the kind of abstraction that is needed for LESS to be powerful</strong>, as defined by Abelson and Sussman. Because you can now name a group of styles (mixin) and then use that name in another group of styles (mixin application), <strong>LESS has full-on recursive style definitions</strong>. With extension, it also has recursive selector definitions. In LESS, we can talk of &quot;levels of abstraction&quot; whereas in CSS there was only one.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>LESS has recursion</strong>. It lets you define and name groups of properties, then refer to those groups by name in other groups of properties. We can consider LESS powerful enough to express useful abstractions. Yet though it is more powerful than CSS, it still has many of the problems of CSS (especially complex rules governing the combination of multiple rules to a single element). How can LESS be leveraged to gain its power but tame its weakness? <strong>Is there a subset of LESS that can gerrymander the good parts away from the bad parts?</strong></p>

<p>Summary: <em>According to the requirements proposed by Abelson and Sussman, CSS does not provide adequate means of combination and abstraction to be considered a powerful language.</em></p>
<p>I am trying to improve the maintainability and reusability of my CSS over the longterm. I've written about <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/cascading-separation-abstraction">how to organize CSS</a> before. I've learned a lot since I wrote that. I've tried lots of things and talked to lots of people, I finally seem to have found a conceptual framework to capture my new understanding. I'm trying to explore it here. <a href="http://twitter.com/ericnormand">Comments are welcome.</a></p>
<p>I'm going to take a cue from the first page of <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> and analyze CSS as a language.</p>
<p>Abelson and Sussman in <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1">SICP 1.1</a> (<em>italics</em> mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as <em>a framework within which we organize our ideas</em> about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to <em>the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas</em>. <em>Every powerful language has three mechanisms</em> for accomplishing this:</p>
<p><strong>primitive expressions</strong>, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,</p>
<p><strong>means of combination</strong>, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and</p>
<p><strong>means of abstraction</strong>, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's analyze CSS in terms of these three mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="primitive-expressions">Primitive Expressions</h3>
<p>The <em>simplest entities the language is concerned with</em> are <em>properties</em> and <em>primitive selectors</em>. CSS properties, though they have a property name and property value part, are meaningless if split up. Primitive selectors include element name selectors (<code>body</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>div</code>), class name selectors (<code>.main-wrapper</code>), id selectors (<code>#login-form</code>), and pseudo-class selectors (<code>:hover</code>), among others. Properties appear inside the rule body (<code>{}</code>), while selectors appear before the rule body. <strong>The two are semantically and syntactically separated.</strong></p>
<h3 id="means-of-combination">Means of Combination</h3>
<p><em>Properties</em> can be combined in two ways. First, <strong>multiple properties can be put inside the same rule body</strong>. This is the most obvious and most readable form of property combination. The second form is harder to reason about. It occurs automatically within the browser during rendering. That form of combination, involving the application of multiple rule bodies to the same HTML element, uses a <strong>complex ordering of properties from all bits of CSS and element styles on the page</strong>.</p>
<p>Tomes have been written about how difficult it is to reason about this automatic form of combination. Usually, the answer is <strong>limiting it (or avoiding it altogether) through programmer discipline</strong>, with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p><em>Primitive selectors</em> can be combined in several ways. Without spaces between them, multiple selectors will <em>intersect</em>, meaning they target elements more specifically. <code>div.main-container</code> will target <code>div</code> elements that ALSO have the class <code>main-container</code>.</p>
<p>With spaces, multiple selectors indicate <em>nesting</em>. <code>div .main-container</code> matches any element of class <code>main-container</code> within any <code>div</code>. There are several operators which combine them in different ways (<code>&gt;</code> indicates direct nesting, etc.). Nested selectors are associated with CSS that is <strong>strongly coupled with the structure of the HTML</strong> it is styling and therefore <strong>less reusable</strong>.</p>
<p>Selectors that are combined with commas create a <em>group</em>. These compound selectors will match any element that matches at least one of the component selectors. <code>header, .header</code> will match all <code>header</code> elements and all elements with class <code>header</code>.</p>
<p>There are more types of selector combintation operators, but they are more specialized and less frequently used.</p>
<p>The locus of combination, for both properties and selectors, is the <em>rule</em>. The rule has one compound selector and zero or more properties. Rules with zero properties have no effect.</p>
<h3 id="means-of-abstraction">Means of Abstraction</h3>
<p>The means of abstraction in CSS are quite limited. There is no way to name <em>anything</em>. People lament the lack of named values (often refered to as <em>variables</em>) or named styles (sometimes called <em>mixins</em>). <strong>Naming is out in CSS.</strong></p>
<p>The only means of abstraction is the class and id, which are labels that can be applied to HTML elements. With an id or class (or combinations), you can target precisely the elements you need to and achieve some reuse. For instance, I can &quot;reuse&quot; the <code>#login-form</code> id selector in two different rules. I can also <strong>add the class <code>rounded-corner</code> to two different HTML elements, effectively &quot;reusing&quot; the same rule twice</strong>. By a <em>very disciplined</em> use of class selectors by combining them with commas, one can apply &quot;rule bodies&quot; as a unit in a <em>very limited way</em>, though it is <strong>impracticable in practice</strong>.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to this technique of using id and class selectors is that the HTML must be modified when styles change, defeating the purpose of using CSS for content/style separation. There is a lot of discussion about using semantically named classes. For instance, call the button <code>login-button</code> instead of <code>green-shiny-button</code>. This is thought to be more robust in the face of style changes, but <strong>requires existing CSS to be thrown away</strong> in order for the page to be redesigned. <strong>CSS offers no good way to modify HTML and CSS independently.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>CSS does not meet the criteria for a &quot;powerful language&quot; as used in SICP.</strong> This is no surprise. The reasonable means of combination are limited to the rule. The means of abstraction are almost non-existent. There is no way to name anything. And the other form of abstraction (ids and classes) provides no way of reusing both the HTML and the CSS. <strong>It is obvious why CSS is typically unmaintainable.</strong> With the current crop of compile-to-CSS languages (commonly known as &quot;CSS Preprocessors&quot;), there is hope that better means of abstraction are possible. <strong><a href="http://www.lispcast.com/less-abstraction-combination">How will compile-to-CSS languages fare in this same analysis?</a></strong></p>

<a href="http://ro-che.info/ccc/17" title="Why static vs dynamic typing battles are rarely interesting."><img src="/img/typing.png" alt="Typing Comic from Cartesian Closed Comics" /></a>
</center>
</p>
<p>All sarcasm aside, the above diagram has a kernel of truth. The important thing to note is that the intersection between &quot;Proponents of dynamic typing&quot; and &quot;People familiar with type theory&quot; is very small.</p>
<p>In an effort to increase the size of that intersection, I decided to familiarize myself with a little more type theory. I developed an implementation of Hindley-Milner which operates on a simple Lisp-like λ-calculus with let polymorphism. Everything you need for Hindley-Milner Algorithm W.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Hindley-Milner is a type system that is used by ML and Haskell. Algorithm W is a fast algorithm for inferencing Hindley-Milner which is syntax-directed (meaning it is based on the type of expression) and recursively defined. In this way, it is similar to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html">Lisp's <code>eval</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>I based my implementation on a paper called <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.65.7733&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><em>Algorithm W Step by Step</em></a> which implemented it in Haskell. My implementation started very similar to that implementation and diverged as I refactored it into a more Clojure-esque style.</p>
<p>This implementation uses no in-place mutation, instead using a &quot;substitution style&quot; which is slightly harder to read. It is, however, easier to write and prove correct.</p>
<p>In addition to the type inferencer, I wrote an interpreter for the same language, just because. My original intent was to expose (to myself) the similarities between syntax-driven type inference and <code>eval</code>. There might be some, but the full clarity I desire is yet many refactorings away. Note that the interpreter and type inferencer are completely independent, except that both apply to the same set of expressions.</p>
<p>I added a couple of minor luxuries to the language having to do with currying. Writing fully parentheisized function applications for curried functions is a pain, as is writing a hand-curried function with multiple arguments. I added two syntax transformations which transform them into a more Lispy style. For example:</p>
<pre><code>(fn [a b c d e f] 1) =&gt; (fn a (fn b (fn c (fn d (fn e (fn f 1))))))</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>(+ 1 2) =&gt; ((+ 1) 2)</code></pre>
<p>I'm pretty sure the syntactic transformation is completely safe. All of my tests still type check.</p>
<p>The final luxury is that it is a lazily-evaluated language. That's not strictly necessary, but it is strictly cool. It builds up thunks (Clojure delays and promises) and a trampoline is used to get the values out. This lets me define <code>if</code> as a function. The only special forms are <code>let</code> and <code>fn</code>.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-find-it">Where to find it</h3>
<p>You can find the code in the <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/hindley-milner">ericnormand/hindley-milner</a> Github repo. I don't promise that it has no bugs. But it does have a small and growing test suite. Pull requests are welcome and I will continue to expand and refactor it.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h3>
<p>Type unification is why the error messages of most type inferencers are so bad. Unification by default only has local knowledge and is commutative (<code>unify a b == unify b a</code>). No preference is given to either argument. A lot of work must have gone into making the error messages of Haskell as good as they are.</p>
<p>Let polymorphism is useful and I'm glad that Haskell has it.</p>
<p>Hindley-Milner is powerful, but it does not by itself work magic on a languageq. A language still requires a lot of good design and a well-chosen set of types.</p>
<h3 id="your-turn">Your turn</h3>
<p>I think you should implement Hindley-Milner in the language of your choice for a small toy λ-calculus. There is a lot to learn from it, even if you never program using a Hindley-Milner language. At the very least, you'll know what the fuss is about.</p>
<p>If you think it would be helpful, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/hindley-milner">my implementation</a>. Like I said, pull requests are welcome.</p>

              React: Another Level of Indirection

<blockquote>
<p>Any problem in computer science can be solved with another level of indirection. -- David Wheeler</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> library from Facebook makes DOM programming functional by using a Virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM is an <em>indirection mechanism</em> that solves the difficult problem of DOM programming: <strong>how to deal with incremental changes to a stateful tree structure</strong>. By abstracting away the statefulness, the Virtual DOM turns the real DOM into an immediate mode GUI, which is perfect for functional programming. Further, the Virtual DOM provides <strong>the last piece of the Web Frontend Puzzle for ClojureScript</strong>.</p>
<p>David Nolen has written up a <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/">short explanation</a> of how the Virtual DOM works, as well as some amazing performance benchmarking of React in a ClojureScript context. His work is important, so you should read it. I'd like to focus a bit more on the expressivity and why <strong>I would use React even if it were not so fast</strong>.</p>
<p>One can view MVC frameworks as an attempt to impose some structure on the code that has to interface with the DOM. The bargain they propose is this: <strong>wrap the DOM in View objects</strong>, so that subtrees of DOM nodes are managed by a View object. <strong>Wrap your state in Model objects</strong>, which will notify the View objects of changes. You thereby keep a <em>layer of indirection between Models and Views</em>, which inherently need different structure and need to change independently.</p>
<p>The layer of indirection (usually an event or observer system) solves a <em>coupling problem</em>. It decouples your state from the DOM, while <strong>leaving you to deal with all of the difficulties of the DOM</strong>. You are essentially making a new type of DOM that is better suited to your GUI domain than plain HTML, but is still a PITA. It is little more than a coat of paint. <em>The DOM is still stateful.</em></p>
<p>React takes a different approach. It provides a level of indirection which solves the actual problem with the DOM--statefulness. The DOM has become a smart canvas. <strong>Paint the whole picture again, but only the different parts get wet.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of wrapping the DOM in View objects, you create a Virtual DOM (completely managed by React) which mirrors the real DOM. When the model changes, you generate a new Virtual DOM. The differences are calculated and converted into batch operations to the real DOM. In essence, <strong>React is a function which takes two DOMs and generates a list of DOM operations</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, <strong>it's referentially transparent</strong>.</p>
<p>It's easy to imagine how this changes the game. <strong>You no longer need an initializer to set up the DOM and observers to modify it.</strong> The first Virtual DOM rendering is like the second one, in fact like any other! Your &quot;View&quot;, if you want to call it that, is simply a function from state to Virtual DOM nodes. <strong>If the state and DOM nodes are immutable, all the better.</strong> There's less work to know if it has changed.</p>
<p>This also means that your Views can be composed functionally. Define a component (as a function) and your subcomponents, and build them up functionally. All of the functional abstraction and refactoring that you're used to is available. If you're doing it right, <strong>your code should get shorter, easier to read, and more fun to maintain</strong>.</p>
<p>My (short) experience rewriting a program to use React converted me. It was the only library I have used that actually made DOM programming fun and functional--and dare I say my code now works!</p>
<p>Which gets me to my last point, which is that React is the final puzzle piece for ClojureScript web frontend development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem: <strong>Global state management</strong></li>
<li><p>Solution: Atoms and persistent data structures</p></li>
<li>Problem: <strong>Client-server communication</strong></li>
<li><p>Solution: EDN (also solved pretty well by JSON)</p></li>
<li>Problem: <strong>Callback hell</strong></li>
<li><p>Solution: core.async</p></li>
<li>Problem: <strong>Stateful DOM</strong></li>
<li><p>Solution: React</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any other problems left? I can't think of any. That's something to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ericnormand"><em>discuss on Twitter</em></a>.</p>
<p>I suggest you try React. <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om"><em>Om</em></a> by David Nolen is the most mature React ClojureScript library I know of. It does a bit more than I've described here (Om manages your state tree for you, among other things) and is evolving quickly. I have some code that generates React Virtual DOM using <code>hiccup</code> style with macros (so the work is done at compile time), but other than that, contains only half-baked implementations of what's in Om. If you're interested in the <code>hiccup</code> macros, <em>let me know what you'd use it for and I'll put it on github</em>.</p>

<p>Because if you think about it, the stack itself is just an optimization. Right? There are these frames which contain information about each invocation. Each stack frame. Each activation record. And that's what they are--they're activation records. They're sort of objects. If you really have objects on the brain, like I do, then you realize that they're all just objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And they should be treated uniformly. You can even build a language that works this way--as I have. If that's the case, this is really a garbage collection problem. Right? Your stack traces might go away if you don't need them. You do need them when it's not a tail call because you need to go back there and use that information. But if it's a tail call, you don't need them, you don't need a tail call back to that frame. You need a pointer back to the last frame that wasn't a tail call. And they might get collected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which doesn't mean you actually have to implement it that way. Erlang sort of does. And there are many implementations that do that. They are not noted for their speed. If you can have real stacks, what happens when you run out of space? If you don't run out of space, it didn't really matter if you optimized the tail calls or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run out of space, you should GC the damned stack. You shouldn't just throw up your hands and say you're dead. And for all the normal programs that people write where it didn't matter, they won't care. And for your tail recursive programs, well, they might be a bit slower, but they will work. And then it's a matter of flags to the garbage collector if in production you don't want to debug it if you're sure it's all going to be fine--then go ahead and tell it to don't bother and just slam it and overwrite those frames directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this so hard for implementers to do? Optimization is an optimization and should be optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a cool algorithm, but there's nothing nice that I'm prepared to say about Hindley-Milner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He nails a lot of things I didn't like about Haskell.</p>
<p>All in all, this talk gets a lot of things right.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is a great service, especially for the lone developer who wants free hosting for an app.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> The free hosting works just like the paid service except that your server will be &quot;spun down&quot;, meaning that after five minutes of no activity, <strong>your server is stopped</strong>. It will be &quot;spun up&quot; again when there is a request. This spin up process can take a while and certainly <strong>does not give a good user experience</strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily there is a recommended way of avoiding this delay. The solution is to run <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> monitoring, which periodically polls your server, avoiding the five minutes of no activity and hence <strong>keeping your server running</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to keeping your server from falling asleep, it also gathers lots of profiling information that could help you understand your server as it runs in production. Luckily, <strong>both Heroku and New Relic offer free tiers</strong>. This brings us to my favorite financial formula:</p>
<center>
<strong>Free + Free = Free</strong>
</center>


<p>You can also use this process with the paid versions. Note also that <strong>Heroku itself recommends setting this up</strong>, so don't feel guilty!</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>I am assuming you are already using Heroku and have a working app hosted there, using an uberjar deploy. You also have the <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com">Heroku Toolbelt</a> installed.</p>
<h3 id="add-the-new-relic-add-on-to-your-app.">1. Add the New Relic add-on to your app.</h3>
<pre><code>$ heroku addons:add newrelic:stark</code></pre>
<p>I recommend the <code>stark</code> plan for free apps. You can choose any of the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/newrelic#stark">New Relic tiers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="find-and-download-the-latest-new-relic-java-api-release.">2. Find and download the latest New Relic Java API release.</h3>
<p><a href="http://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/">This download page</a> lists all of the versions. Find the latest one and download the ZIP file.</p>
<h3 id="unzip-the-zip-file-into-the-base-of-your-app.">3. Unzip the ZIP file into the base of your app.</h3>
<pre><code>$ cd projects/my-app
$ unzip ~/Downloads/newrelic-java-3.2.0.zip</code></pre>
<p>It should unzip into a <code>newrelic/</code> directory.</p>
<h3 id="check-your-.gitignore-file-for-.jar">4. Check your <code>.gitignore</code> file for <code>*.jar</code></h3>
<p>New Relic includes its own JAR file which needs to be deployed with your app in the git repo. My <code>.gitignore</code> included a line <code>*.jar</code> which would exclude all JAR files. Remove this line if you see it.</p>
<h3 id="add-the-.gitignore-and-the-newrelic-directory-to-your-repo.">5. Add the .gitignore and the <code>newrelic/</code> directory to your repo.</h3>
<pre><code>$ git add .gitignore
$ git add newrelic
$ git commit -m &quot;Add New Relic monitoring agent.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Make sure the file <code>newrelic/newrelic.jar</code> was added.</p>
<h3 id="release-to-heroku.">6. Release to Heroku.</h3>
<pre><code>$ git push heroku master</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-your-app-to-use-new-relic.">7. Configure your app to use New Relic.</h3>
<p>We need to add a new JVM option. There is an environment variable called <code>JVM_OPTS</code> which is typically used to do this. Find out what value it has now.</p>
<pre><code>$ heroku config</code></pre>
<p>Find the line starting with <code>JVM_OPTS:</code>. Mine says &quot;<code>-Xmx400m</code>&quot;. Now we add this to the variable: &quot;<code>-javaagent:newrelic/newrelic.jar</code>&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>$ heroku config:set JVM_OPTS=&quot;-Xmx400m -javaagent:newrelic/newrelic.jar&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The app should restart with the new options. Visit your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps">Heroku dashboard</a>, find your app, and click on the New Relic addon to see the New Relic Dashboard for your app. The first load might take some time, but subsequent loads will be at full speed and it won't spin down. load!</p>
