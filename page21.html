<p>Stuart Halloway continues the world-round campaign of iconoclastic and well-argumented presentations that spring from Clojure's programming model and now Datomic's architecture. Stuart gives hard-hitting, reasoned practices that make our software better in measurable ways.</p>
<p>This is just one of the many ways Clojure is having (and will have) a huge impact on programming in any language. Immutable data by default is obvious. A model of time, while not so obvious, will seem like manual memory management does now. Sure, you can work with it, but who would give up garbage collection? Similarly, having a better model of state change (transactional or otherwise) enforced by the language will be something we will not want to live without.</p>
<p>Separating data from code will take years, maybe a generation, to catch on. Our field has drilled the Java model of Object-Orientation into students for years. But the change has already started. Though not being led by Clojure, JSON is now a universal data format accepted by nearly every language, and the fact that the standard does not allow code in JSON is significant.</p>
<p>But this talk goes a little further and proposes that we think of databases differently. Stuart does a good job of breaking down why OO and RDBMS don't fit well together, and proposes a solution that leaves them both in the dust.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>A bootleg video of a talk from Strange Loop 2012.</p>
<p>I do not think the official videos are up yet. For those of us who could not make it to the conference, this is great, even though it was recorded with an iPhone. You can hear Nolen well and see the slides.</p>
<p>The presentation starts with a short review of how to use <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic">core.logic</a> before Nolen goes into the implementation details. I still need to spend some time understanding the code myself. core.logic is based on miniKanren, described in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262562146?tag=lisp0b-20"><em>The Reasoned Schemer</em></a>.</p>
<p>Actually, I have just bought a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992?tag=lisp0b-20"><em>The Little Schemer</em></a>, the first book in the series of which <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262562146?tag=lisp0b-20"><em>The Reasoned Schemer</em></a> is a part.

<p>Michael Fogus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the greatest limitation of Haskell's type system? The greatest limitation in Haskell's type system is it only does Haskell's type system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally agree. Almost two years of working in Haskell has convinced me of the benefit of static type analysis. It can catch a lot of bugs. But Haskell's type system also increases the amount of code and the surface area of your interface. The types become a point of coupling. They become hard to change without changing everything that uses them.</p>
<p>This rigidity is where their power comes from, and also their annoyance. Well-chosen types can stabilize a system in a good way. Mistakes in the types, or changes in their requirements, stabilize the system in a bad way.</p>
<p>I would love to see a type checker that could handle non-discriminated union types (Haskell has discriminated unions, which force you to box and unbox values, adding to code size and coupling to the types). It would be nice to have the type checker say &quot;Function foo takes either a String or a Number, but on line 34 you pass it a String or Number or HashMap.&quot;</p>
<p>Another type of analysis I would like to see is whether a function is pure, does IO, or accesses mutable state. You can tag all basic IO operations as IO. Then anything that calls one of those operations also gets the tag IO. Similarly for mutable state. Haskell makes IO a type so that it can be statically checked, because Haskell only does type checking. It is not really a type, though, and does not need static type analysis.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of static checking in a dynamic language is that the definition of functions can change at any time. So function foo could compile, but with a warning that it calls function bar incorrectly. When you correct function bar, the warning goes away automatically.</p>
<p>Those are some ideas I had watching that video and thinking about static analysis in Clojure. I am quite excited.</p>

            On the configurations of data and functions
          </a>
        </h2>

        <div class="timestamp">
          September 21, 2012
        </div>

        
<p>Rich Hickey recently commented (I cannot remember where) that there are a limited number of useful configurations of data. He claimed that the Clojure literal syntax is just about right. The one thing to add to it is the extensibility that we now have with 1.4.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Part of the context was that we as programmers should be separating data from process. The separation makes our data more reusable. A string is a string in any language. An array is an array. Data is data and should be regarded as such. This allows for much more reuse than object oriented programming ever has. We can see the tremendous success of JSON as a case in point: a well-defined, constrained data language that gets it mostly right.</p>
<p>But Hickey's point goes a little farther, I think. It is not just data that is reusable, but functions as well. Look at the enormous savings in the amount of code required to get a Swing app running when you use <a href="https://github.com/daveray/seesaw">Seesaw</a>. I am not just talking only about the incessant boilerplate anonymous class declarations Swing forces you to write. I am talking also about the fact that I can use any function to handle an event. I do not need to figure out what class the thing is expecting. Defining a subclass of a single class is inherently non-reusable.</p>
<p>And it is not just that I don't need to know the class. I can use a function written in a library that has no dependencies on Swing or Seesaw at all. A function is just a function. It is universal and reusable, not because of some well-modeled domain classes, but because it is abstract and applies to no domain in particular.</p>
<p>While Hickey is working on a universal, extensible data format, who is working on the universal function format?</p>

<p>James Coplien's criticism of Java (that it cannot do proper object-oriented programming) is my essential criticism of static languages in general: <em>what if the model of programs that your language enforces does not allow you to program well?</em></p>
<p>Coplien describes a style of programming that, although not especially encouraged by Smalltalk, was at least possible as an architectural convention. And listening to Alan Kay, I get the impression that the early Smalltalk group was programming with a concept like Roles in mind, though there was no explicit construct for it in the language.</p>
<p>That concept was what we now refer to as &quot;duck typing&quot;. To fulfill a &quot;methodful role&quot;, you simply needed to have all of the required methods defined.</p>
<p>Now, how would Clojure handle DCI? Well, quite naturally, actually. There are three building block concepts in DCI described in the video, each with a terrible name.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Classes (data)</li>
<li>Methodful Roles (interfaces)</li>
<li>Methodless Roles (variables)</li>
</ol>
<p>In Clojure, &quot;classes&quot; are simply data, perhaps validated to conform to a schema, perhaps wrapped in a <code>ref</code> to get state. &quot;Methodful roles&quot; are groups of functions that can operate on data. If you're feeling frisky, you can use protocols. &quot;Methodless roles&quot; are variables in your program, each assigned to the data which will play that role.</p>
<p>Let's look at the main example in Clojure.</p>
<pre><code>;; money source role: debit and balance
(defn debit [source amount]
  (update-in source [:balance] #(- % amount)))

(defn balance [source]
  (:balance source))

;; money destination role: credit
(defn credit [dest amount]
    (update-in dest [:balance] #(+ % amount)))

;; the use case for doing a transfer    
(defn transfer [amount source destination]
  (dosync
    (when (&lt; (balance @source) amount)
      (throw (ex-info &quot;Insufficient funds.&quot; {:account @source :amount amount})))
    (alter   source       debit amount) ;; debiting is not commutative if we check balance
    (commute destination credit amount)))

;; our two accounts
(def savings  (ref {:balance 1000}))
(def checking (ref {:balance 25}))

;; we can transfer 20 bucks from savings to checking
(transfer 20 savings checking)</code></pre>
<p>I wrote this just to make sure I was not kidding myself that &quot;DCI&quot; is dead-obvious if your language does not get in the way. Object-oriented conventions today make this complicated enough that you need to read books on it to understand. How many files would you need to write in Java to do this?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>MoneySource interface</li>
<li>MondeyDestination interface</li>
<li>Transfer Use Case</li>
<li>Account Class (or two, depending on the differences between savings and checking)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can modify the account class(es) to implement the interfaces, you should be ok with those files. But if you can't, you'll have to use the &quot;Bridge&quot; pattern that I learned in school. Basically, you make a new class for each combination of class and interface. So you would have SavingsAccountMoneySource, SavingsAccountMoneyDestination, CheckingAccountMoneySource, and CheckingAccountMoneyDestination. And OOP was supposed to need less code!</p>
<p>This video tells me that object-oriented programming as it is taught today has been going way down the wrong track. The lessons the static object-oriented languages have learned from the dynamic ones are the wrong lessons. Duck typing allowed programmers to elegantly implement these ideas without restrictions from the compiler. And inheritance was about reuse more than subtyping. Modern OO style takes and does not give back.</p>

<p>Haskell just got a whole lot more useful for prototyping. One of my biggest gripes with Haskell was how much code had to be changed if a single type was altered<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, since the compiler was always looking for consistent types. There were ways to work around it<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>, but they were always tedious and unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>This new development in 7.6 lets you compile and run the code, changing type signatures many times, before you have to propagate the change through the rest of the code.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This is the classical definition of tight coupling. That's right: static typing introduces coupling.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>How to do it? Never change a type signature. Instead, create a new name with the same value, and modify that. Then, when it has settled into its permanent type signature, rename it to the old name, recompile, and let the error messages guide you.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>

<p>A Lisp written in Javascript with first-class environments and first-class continuations. The README claims it starts in 50ms on modern browsers. Looks interesting.</p>
