<p>Steve Yegge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software engineering has its own political axis, ranging from conservative to liberal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steve, I am so often with you. Typically, you write stuff that is very concrete and easy to agree with. In fact, I agree with most of what you have written in your very long rants.</p>
<p>But this, I am afraid, is bullshit. Not right, not wrong, just <em>bullshit</em>.</p>
<p>I was giving you the benefit of the doubt until I read your list of categorized features, either conservative or liberal. That list made absolutely no objective sense. <strong>There is not one shred of a good idea in the dichotomy you gave.</strong></p>
<p>The dichotomy conflates so many different dichotomies into a single one in the name of clarifying a terrible mess. In that way, it makes the same mistake as classifying people into conservative and liberal does. It does not help explain anything. And <strong>it only creates more fighting by arming people with names to call each other</strong>.</p>
<p>Which is more &quot;liberal&quot;, Common Lisp or C? Common Lisp protects against the most common types of C errors: memory leaks and buffer overflows. Does that make Common Lisp more conservative because it protects the programmer from errors? But C has compile-time type checks! And &quot;conservative&quot; syntax! Bullshit!</p>
<p>But then came the clincher. When you said that Clojure was a conservative language, <strong>I came up with something which may actually have some merit: how <em>opinionated</em> the language is</strong>.</p>
<p>Clojure is strongly opinionated. So is Python. So is Haskell.</p>
<p>Clojure's opinions: state changes should be explicit, values should be immutable, functions should be separated from data, etc.</p>
<p>Python's opinion: code should be well-indented.</p>
<p>Haskell's opinions: functions should be pure, types should be consistent.</p>
<p>These languages may appear conservative because, in their respective worlds, <strong>the opinions are solidified into laws and imposed on the programmer</strong>. Python does not allow you to write unindented code. Haskell does not allow you to write programs with inconsistent types. You cannot mutate a Clojure map.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps, Steve, you mean to say that you don't like when a programming language's opinion is imposed on the programmer?</strong></p>
<p>I personally like some laws and dislike others. For instance, Clojure's immutability is great. <strong>It's not just great because it's possible. It's great because it is enforced.</strong> Nothing can change my values--not me, not you, not anyone! And I like Haskell's type system in production but not during development. I like that my program is guaranteed to have consistent types on production. But in development, I'd rather run it and debug it (for some definition of &quot;run&quot; for a type-inconsistent Haskell program).</p>
<p><strong>If you say it like that, it ceases to be bullshit.</strong> And then we can get back into a discussion. Question: Which features should be imposed on the programmer and which should not? Discuss.</p>

<p>Rich Hickey is a force of nature. The mark he will leave on programming will reach much farther than the Clojure programming language. The agenda he is setting forth will have as much impact on the notion of state as McCarthy conditionals had on structured programming.</p>
<p>Please listen closely. The main idea of this talk goes far deeper than &quot;immutable good, mutable bad&quot;.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be a part of this.</p>

<p>According to Daniel Spiewak, Clojure's vec requires, in the worst case, 7 array accesses and 14 bit operations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On really large datasets--this just astonished me when I discovered it--on really large datasets this data structure [<em>Clojure vec</em>] beats java.util.ArrayList for lookup. It beats java.util.ArrayList for datasets that are in the 2 billion range. That is incredibly fast. java.util.ArrayList is an array, right? And we're beating an array.</p>

<p>Phil Windley set up his own URL shortener system. He made it use Apache. It could also work on Amazon S3 (like this very blog). It would be super cheap and virtually maintenance-free. I love it.</p>

<p>I originally dismissed <a href="https://github.com/reiddraper/knockbox">Knockbox</a> as yet another concurrency paradigm for Clojure. But after watching this lecture by its creator, I have changed my mind. The few use cases he gives are enough to convince me that I may someday use it, if only to give a bit of structure to edit conflict resolution.</p>
<p>It appears to follow the Clojure library trend and implements work from a <a href="http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00555588/">published academic paper</a>.</p>
<p>I will keep it in mind when I want lock-free eventual consistency.</p>

<p>Chas Emerick is at it again. Please fill in the survey if you have ever been exposed to Clojure. This is the third year that cemerick has conducted the survey. He does a great job at summarizing the data with nice graphs. Have a look at the <a href="http://cemerick.com/2011/07/11/results-of-the-2011-state-of-clojure-survey/">2011</a> and <a href="http://cemerick.com/2010/06/07/results-from-the-state-of-clojure-summer-2010-survey/">2010</a> survey results. The survey is useful to the entire community. Please participate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now imagine there are two finished apps that solve roughly identical problems. One is enjoyable to use and popular and making a lot of money. The other just doesn't feel right in a difficult to define way. One of these apps follows all of your development ideals, but which app is it? What if the successful product is riddled with singletons, doesn't check result codes after allocating memory (but the sizes of these allocations are such that failures only occur in pathological cases), and the authors don't know about test-driven development?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine two pieces of medical equipment. One is easy to use, easy to clean, and always reliable. The other is buggy, has lots of crevices and corner which seem to collect infected goo, and needs constant maintenance. One of these apps was created by a rigorous design process, extensive testing, and built in an immaculate, air-conditioned factory manned by attractive MD/PhDs. The other was created in a basement from spare parts by a high school dropout with bad hygiene. What if the beautiful machine was created by the dropout?</p>
<p>Is it even possible? Is it possible that software can be successful over time if it is not well-built? In my experience, messy software eventually drags new development (including bug fixes) to a halt. Time needs to be invested in cleanup.</p>
<p>What I hear Hague saying is that some software architecture choices do not matter. This is true. But some do matter. They are not just important to you as a programmer. They are directly related to the number of bugs, the time it takes to fix a bug, and the time it takes to make a new feature. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
