<p>I would like to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/376627045/lispcast-introduction-to-clojure-videos">my Kickstarter project</a>. It is a project to develop screencasts to introduce Clojure to programmers everywhere.</p>
<p>Video is a great way to learn programming. For one, you get to watch the program being developed organically, not as a static artifact (as in a book). Also, a voiceover gives a direct stream into the thought process of the programmer as he types. Finally, you can stop and replay as much as you want to learn at your own pace. Those things, combined with video's ability to engage a large part of your brain make it a great learning tool.</p>
<p>This blog was first created to host screencasts I made for Common Lisp, way back when. I transitioned to Clojure after watching a talk by Rich Hickey at <a href="http://lisp50.blogspot.com/">Lisp50</a> in 2008. I was very impressed and have not looked back.</p>
<p>I have loved education ever since I taught math in the Peace Corps. I really enjoyed making those Common Lisp videos as well. I wanted to turn it into something like <a href="https://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>, but my day job interceded and I didn't have the comfort level with Clojure that I did with Common Lisp. The videos got put on hold.</p>
<p>That was almost five years ago and I feel very confident with my ability to teach Clojure. Plus, video production has advanced a lot. I will be able to produce very high-quality videos much more easily than five years ago. And Kickstarter has provided a nearly risk-free way to test the market.</p>
<p>If this project does well, I hope to make it into a profitable business and produce more and more videos, especially videos about deeper topics. But only if the project proves itself in the very large beginner's market. Let your friends know about this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/376627045/lispcast-introduction-to-clojure-videos">great opportunity</a> to learn Clojure. You can find the Kickstarter project <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/376627045/lispcast-introduction-to-clojure-videos">here</a>.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal, if the project proves out, is to provide exceptional educational materials to build a strong developer culture. <a href="http://clojuregazette.com/">Clojure Gazette</a> shares this same goal.</p>
<p>One hour of video will cost $5 to the Kickstarter supporters. After that, the price will go up to $12. This is a very good value for one hour of instructional video. There is also a company sponsorship level. See the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/376627045/lispcast-introduction-to-clojure-videos">Kickstarter page</a> for more details. The project ends March 14, 2013.</p>
<p>Please support the project and let other people know.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>A lot of web software converts ASCII single- and double-quote characters into special, non-ASCII open and close versions. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark_glyphs">smart quotes</a>&quot;. Their less intelligent ASCII equivalents are &quot;dumb quotes&quot;. Smart quotes undoubtedly look better.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p>&quot;Some text&quot; becomes “Some text”.</p>
<p>Very pretty, no? There is no smart quote key on your keyboard, so in order to make them, your software will convert them automagically. I say &quot;automagically&quot; because they are often converted incorrectly. There are no simple rules to convert them correctly.</p>
<p>I used to upgrade my dumb quotes to smart, but a couple of years ago I decided against it. Although I would like to have prettier quotes, they annoy me on other people's sites, even when they are correctly chosen.</p>
<p>Specifically, they <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1088506/smart-quotes-without-breaking-copy-and-paste">break copy-paste</a>. When you copy text with smart quotes (and smart apostrophes, smart dashes, and other smart characters), you get crap in your text. I like copy-paste and I do not want it broken on my site. In fact, I would love it if the world stopped using smart quotes.</p>

<p>In April 2011, Google acquired ITA Software. ITA provides airline flight search for several of the major companies. The interesting thing is that ITA's search engine was written in Common Lisp.</p>
<p>This style guide shows that Google is adopting the existing Lisp code base instead of rewriting it. Not so surprising since the code is, from what I have heard, well-engineered. But a bit surprising since Google chose Python over Lisp some time ago. Peter Norvig explains the choice a bit on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE7k0_9k0VA#t=03m20s">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1803815">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, it also shows that Google is affecting ITA with its culture, to some degree. Google uses this format for <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">all of its style guides</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I love style guides!</p>

            Static vs. Dynamic Typing

        <div class="timestamp">
          October 05, 2012

<p>I was reading <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/167305/what-functionality-does-dynamic-typing-allow">this question</a> on Stack Exchange asking what is possible in a dynamically typed language that is impossible in a statically typed language. Most of the responses were terrible. It reminded me that <strong>the level of discussion surrounding the topic of types in general is very disappointing.</strong> Basically, most people do not know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the answerers posted a link to <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/08/what-to-know-before-debating-type-systems.html">this post about debating type systems</a>. I had never read it before and I am glad I have, now.</p>
<p>The author takes the approach of describing how people generally use typing terms as opposed to prescribing a definition. His main point is that the terms are generally misunderstood so much that trying to discuss them is not productive. <strong>There is no agreed-upon definition in most contexts.</strong> I agree. I wish it were not the case, though.</p>
<p>But there was also another gem in the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic and static type systems are two completely different things, whose goals happen to partially overlap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this point is right on. Static type checking is only one possible form of static analysis. And the goal of static analysis is to detect errors as soon as possible. Dynamic typing is used more to perform dynamic type dispatch (that is, runtime polymorphism). Because they have such different goals, why are we even comparing them?</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is C++'s fault. C++ took the idea of Classes and inheritance from OOP and conflated them into static types. But I'm not an expert. Maybe someone did that before C++. By the way, this is probably 90% of why people hate static typing. When static typing prevents something useful (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck typing</a>) but does not present an alternative to that use, you wish you did not have static typing.</p>
<p>The real point is that <strong>static typing and dynamic typing are not inherently mutually exclusive</strong>. For instance, Java has static and dynamic typing. That is, you can ask for the type of an object at runtime, and the types of variables are checked at compile time. Clojure has some form of static analysis (no static type analysis) and inherits the runtime types from Java.</p>
<p>The question &quot;which is a subset of the other?&quot; is actually meaningless. <strong>But the question &quot;if you had to choose a language that only had one, then add the other to it, which would you pick?&quot; is becoming increasingly relevant.</strong> <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/deferring-type-errors-to-runtime">Haskell recently added what some consider to be dynamic typing behavior (throwing type errors at runtime instead of at compile time).</a> <a href="http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/?u=a33b5228d1b5bf2e0c68a83f4&amp;id=c43c157edd">And people are working on static type systems for Clojure.</a></p>
<p>I do not think that this is a subjective question. I think it has one possible answer in the general case. And I would like to present the argument to open up the discussion. I will use Haskell (with the most advanced static type system in the world) and Clojure (it is comparable to Haskell and dynamically typed).</p>
<p>In Clojure, type information is purely informational. It does have Java's inheritance hierarchy, but that is a mere legacy to interoperate with Java. The important part of Clojure is that every value has a type and the program can know the type at runtime. This could be considered the minimal possible dynamic type system: present types at runtime and defer to the program to do what it wishes with them. <strong>The semantics of evaluation are independent of the type system.</strong></p>
<p>In Haskell, type information exists only at compile time. That is, the compiler figures out the type of everything, decides whether to allow the program, then compiles it (if it is allowed). <strong>Types are complected with semantics.</strong> Types determine what code is run. Further, because the type checker has to be able to infer all types, the language has been limited to the subset of possible programs that are checkable. The semantics of the language are limited by the type system.</p>
<p>So what we have is a semantics that is independent of types (Clojure) which we can augment with different static type analyses and potentially catch errors, or we have a language that has already compromised its semantics to the type system and add runtime type annotations, which are effectively useless.</p>
<p>Just one last word: I am not a dynamic typing zealot. I use Haskell more than Clojure. And I am very excited to see static analysis come to Clojure. However, the static typing crowd seems to have the rhetorical upper hand at the moment. I just want to have better discussions.</p>

<p>Stuart Halloway continues the world-round campaign of iconoclastic and well-argumented presentations that spring from Clojure's programming model and now Datomic's architecture. Stuart gives hard-hitting, reasoned practices that make our software better in measurable ways.</p>
<p>This is just one of the many ways Clojure is having (and will have) a huge impact on programming in any language. Immutable data by default is obvious. A model of time, while not so obvious, will seem like manual memory management does now. Sure, you can work with it, but who would give up garbage collection? Similarly, having a better model of state change (transactional or otherwise) enforced by the language will be something we will not want to live without.</p>
<p>Separating data from code will take years, maybe a generation, to catch on. Our field has drilled the Java model of Object-Orientation into students for years. But the change has already started. Though not being led by Clojure, JSON is now a universal data format accepted by nearly every language, and the fact that the standard does not allow code in JSON is significant.</p>
<p>But this talk goes a little further and proposes that we think of databases differently. Stuart does a good job of breaking down why OO and RDBMS don't fit well together, and proposes a solution that leaves them both in the dust.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

I still need to spend some time understanding the code myself. core.logic is based on miniKanren, described in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262562146?tag=lisp0b-20"><em>The Reasoned Schemer</em></a>.</p>
<p>Actually, I have just bought a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992?tag=lisp0b-20"><em>The Little Schemer</em></a>, the first book in the series of which <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262562146?tag=lisp0b-20"><em>The Reasoned Schemer</em></a> is a part. I am trying to catch up on all of these Lisp classics. I will write a review when I am finished, but so far so good.</p>

<p>What is the greatest limitation of Haskell's type system? The greatest limitation in Haskell's type system is it only does Haskell's type system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally agree. Almost two years of working in Haskell has convinced me of the benefit of static type analysis. It can catch a lot of bugs. But Haskell's type system also increases the amount of code and the surface area of your interface. The types become a point of coupling. They become hard to change without changing everything that uses them.</p>
<p>This rigidity is where their power comes from, and also their annoyance. Well-chosen types can stabilize a system in a good way. Mistakes in the types, or changes in their requirements, stabilize the system in a bad way.</p>
<p>I would love to see a type checker that could handle non-discriminated union types (Haskell has discriminated unions, which force you to box and unbox values, adding to code size and coupling to the types). It would be nice to have the type checker say &quot;Function foo takes either a String or a Number, but on line 34 you pass it a String or Number or HashMap.&quot;</p>
<p>Another type of analysis I would like to see is whether a function is pure, does IO, or accesses mutable state. You can tag all basic IO operations as IO. Then anything that calls one of those operations also gets the tag IO. Similarly for mutable state. Haskell makes IO a type so that it can be statically checked, because Haskell only does type checking. It is not really a type, though, and does not need static type analysis.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of static checking in a dynamic language is that the definition of functions can change at any time. So function foo could compile, but with a warning that it calls function bar incorrectly. When you correct function bar, the warning goes away automatically.</p>
<p>Those are some ideas I had watching that video and thinking about static analysis in Clojure. I am quite excited.</p>
