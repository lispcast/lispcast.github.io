<p>Here's a problem you might see on a standardized test:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/logic-puzzle.png" alt="Choose the answer that makes the following statement FALSE: If the Triangle is Red, then the Square is Blue." />
</center></p>

<p>Go ahead and try to solve it. Choose an answer.</p>
<p>When people answer this question on a test, the most common answer is C. Yellow triangle and red square. They try to make the statement false by negating all of the colors.</p>
<p>This is wrong. Actually, the correct answer is A. It is the only one that makes the statement false. Why?</p>
<p>This is a propositional logic problem. The colors and shapes are a red herring. The rule for implication (if-then statement) is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An implication is false if the antecedant is true and the consequent is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kind of boring and therefore hard to understand if you don't already know the rule. It is unlikely that any amount of explanation will help, though you should try to understand if you don't already. Here, try this. If the triangle isn't red, then the statement doesn't apply, so it is true by irrelevance. That eliminates C and D. B obviously makes the statement true, so it must be A.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Researchers found that explanations alone do not help. I read an article<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> about a study where similar questions were asked to a group of students. The students were hooked up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">EEG (Electroencephalography)</a> machines to measure what parts of their brains were active during each question. They also asked them to say which ones they thought they got right.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/eeg.jpg" alt="EEG setup also labeling reasoning/visual areas." />
</center>  
Photo credit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EEG_recording.jpg">Petter Kallioinen</a>
</p>

<p>What they found was that most of the people who answered A were <em>using their frontal and temporal lobes</em>: the parts of the brain responsible for <em>logic, reasoning, and language</em>. Most of the people who answered C were using their <em>occipital lobes</em>, which is responsible for <em>vision</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Moral #1:</strong> Recognize what type of problem you need to solve. If possible, use the right part of your brain for that problem.</p>
<p>The people who used their vision centers were doing visual pattern matching, <em>looking for shapes and colors</em>. This is typical of a fight-or-flight response, where you are running from a tiger and need to quickly spot it in the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>Moral #2:</strong> Don't get nervous during a test. Anxiety makes some parts of your brain more active--usually the wrong ones.</p>
<p>In addition, the people who used their vision center to answer the question <em>thought they got the answer right</em> just as much as the people who actually got it right.</p>
<p><strong>Moral #3:</strong> The different parts of your brain are good at different tasks. If you ask the occipital lobe to do pattern matching, it will, and it will think it did a good job--even if it is not a pattern matching task.</p>
<p>The second part of the study tried to teach those who got it wrong to do it better next time. They broke them into a control group and an experimental group. The control group got an explanation like the boring one above on how to make an implication false. The experimental group got the same explanation plus they were trained with a little <em>bio-feedback to use the right part of the brain</em>.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The result was that the control group didn't make any gains. And they <em>still</em> thought they got it right. The experimental group did significantly better. They scored higher and were more likely to say they got the wrong answer when they did get the wrong answer.</p>
<p><strong>Moral #4:</strong> Explanation alone is basically worthless. Even practice is not enough. The key is to recognize what type of problem it is, use the right part of your brain, and don't listen to the rest of your brain. Only then is explanation useful.</p>
<p>Now, this is easier said than done. I don't have an EEG machine. I've never done bio-feedback. But the <em>idea</em> has helped me tremendously when teaching math. <em>It is not hard to recognize when someone is using the wrong part of their brain.</em> First, they <em>confidently</em> get the wrong answer. Second, they are getting the basic mechanics of the problem wrong. They're <em>looking</em> for something. They find the closest thing to what they want. They're done.</p>
<p><em>Logic problems aren't about looking.</em> They're more abstract. Common helpers for doing logic problems are mouthing words, making gestures, and looking <em>away</em> from the problem.</p>
<p>Recognizing whether someone is using the right part of their brain is easy. But now you know explaining won't help. The hard part is to get them <strong>to use the correct part of the brain</strong>. That's what I'll talk about next time.</p>

            4 Things Java Programmers Can Learn from Clojure without learning Clojure

        <div class="timestamp">
          March 06, 2013
        </div>

        
<p>I was trained in Java at University. The OOP matrix was firmly implanted in my thinking. I wanted to share some things that I have learned from Clojure that were certainly possible in Java but never became fundamental to my programming practice.</p>
<p>Clojure certainly has learned a lot from Java. It might be cool if the learning went both ways. These are universal principles. In fact, these principles are actually well known in the OOP world. You probably already know them, so learning Clojure is not required (but it is recommended!).</p>
<h3 id="use-immutable-values">1. Use immutable values</h3>
<p>One of Clojure's claim to fame is its immutable data structures. But immutable values were appreciated even in the very early days of Java. <code>String</code> is immutable and was a bit controversial when Java came out. Back then, C and C++ strings were simply arrays which could be changed. Immutable Strings were seen as inefficient.</p>
<p>However, looking back, immutable Strings seem to have been the right choice. Many of the mutable Java classes are now seen as mistakes. Take, for example, <code>java.util.Date</code>. What does it mean to change the month of a date?</p>
<p>Let's go a little further. Let's imagine that I'm an object. You ask me when my birthday is. I hand you a piece of paper with July 18, 1981. You take that home, store it somewhere, and even let other people access that piece of paper.</p>
<p>One of those people says &quot;cool, a date!&quot; And changes it to his birthday, April 2, 1976 using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Date.html#setTime(long)"><code>setTime</code></a>. Now the next person who asks for my birthday actually gets that guy's birthday. What a disaster! Why did I give away that magic paper that changes my birthday?</p>
<p>By making values mutable, this magical-changing-at-a-distance is always a possibility. One way to look at the reason it is actually wrong to use mutable values is that it breaks <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">the information hiding principle</a></em>. My birthdate is part of the state of my object. By giving direct access to the month, day, and year, I'm actually letting any class have direct access to my internal state.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is to not have any setters on an object. After construction, the object can't change. That way, my internal state remains encapsulated.</p>
<p>This applies to collections as well. Have you ever read the docs for <code>Iterator</code>. Can you tell what happens when the underlying list changes? Neither can I. An immutable list would not have such a complicated interface.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Don't write setter methods. For collections, you have a couple of options. One easy thing to do is use the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Google Guava</a> <code>Immutable...</code> classes. If using Guava is not an option, whenever you are returning a collection, make a copy, wrap it in a <code>java.util.Collections.unmodifiable...()</code>, and throw away the reference to the copy.</p>
<pre><code>public static Map immutableMap(Map m) {
  return Collections.unmodifiableMap(new HashMap(m));
}</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about immutable values, I suggest watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM">The Value of Values</a>, a talk by Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure.</p>
<iframe width="900" height="506" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-6BsiVyC1kM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3 id="do-no-work-in-the-constructor">2. Do no work in the constructor</h3>
<p>Imagine this situation. Your <code>Person</code> class has a constructor that takes a bunch of information (first name, last name, address, etc.) and stores it in the object's state. Someone on your team needs to store that data to a file, so stores it as JSON. For convenience in creating a Person, you add a constructor that takes an <code>InputStream</code> and parses it as JSON, then sets up the state. Just because, you also add one that takes a <code>File</code>, reads in the file, then parses it. And then one that reads in a web request given a <code>URL</code>. Great! You've got a very convenient class.</p>
<p>But wait! What is the responsibility of the <code>Person</code> class? Originally, it was &quot;represent personal information about a person&quot;. Now it is also responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing JSON</li>
<li>Making web requests</li>
<li>Reading files</li>
<li>Handling errors</li>
</ul>
<p>What's more is that the class is now harder to test. How can you test the <code>File</code> constructor? First, you write a temporary file to the file system. Not too bad. How do you test the web request? Set up a web server, configure it to serve the file, then call the constructor.</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>Person</code> violates <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">the single responsibility principle</a></em>. <code>Person</code> is about keeping bits of information together, not permanent storage or serialization. It should be a data object, no more.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: Solution</strong>: Keep your constructor free of logic. Separate out convenience constructors (like the one that parses JSON) into static factory methods.</p>
<p>To learn more about this idea (and more!), I suggest you watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acjvKJiOvXw">OO Design for Testability</a> by Miško Hevery, the creator of <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.</p>
<iframe width="900" height="675" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/acjvKJiOvXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3 id="program-to-small-interfaces">3. Program to small interfaces</h3>
<p>One thing that Clojure has done very well is to define a set of very powerful, small interfaces which abstract a pattern of access. The interface allows many different types to participate in an &quot;ecosystem&quot;. Any function which applies to the interface can act on any type that implements that interface. Any new type can take advantage of all of the existing functionality already built in.</p>
<p>Take for instance the <code>Iterable</code> interface. It generalizes anything that can be accessed sequentially (such as a list or set). If all a method needs to do is operate on something sequentially, it only needs to know that it implements this interface. That means it can operate on types that were not known to the programmer when the method was written.</p>
<p>This aspect follows from <em><a href="http://www.oodesign.com/dependency-inversion-principle.html">the dependency inversion principle</a></em> which states that high-level logic should be written in terms of abstractions instead of the details of the lower-level logic. Interfaces capture this principle well. High-level logic should operate on interfaces which are implemented by the lower-level logic.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Think hard about the access patterns for classes and see if you can't abstract out small interfaces which pinpoint those access patterns. Then program to those interfaces. Remember, it takes two to use an interface: the implementor and the client. Make sure you use them from both sides as much as possible.</p>
<p>Nothing increases maintainability and the future cost of code more than good interfaces. To learn more about this, I suggest watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw">How To Design A Good API and Why It Matters</a>. It's an older (but good) talk by Joshua Bloch.</p>

<h3 id="represent-computation-not-the-world">4. Represent computation, not the world</h3>
<p>When I was in college, the teacher taught us that you should use classes to model objects in the world. The quintessential modeling problem was students registering for courses.</p>
<p>A course can have many students and a student can be registered in many courses. A many-to-many relationship.</p>
<p>The obvious choice is to make a <code>Student</code> class and a <code>Course</code> class. Each has a list of the other. Inclusion in that list represents registration. Methods like <code>register</code> and <code>listCourses</code> let a Student register or list the courses he's registered in.</p>
<p>Professors would present this problem in order to discuss the tradeoffs of different design choices. None of the configurations of Student and Course were ideal. An astute data modeler would see the pattern of the many-to-many relationship and abstract that out. You can create a class called <code>ManyToMany&lt;X,Y&gt;</code> that manages the relationship. You can create a <code>ManyToMany&lt;CourseID, StudentID&gt;</code> and it solves your problem exactly.</p>
<p>The issue is that this directly contradicts the teacher's lesson. A relationship is not an object in the real world. At best it is an abstract concept.</p>
<p>What's more is that it solves the more general abstract problem as well. The <code>ManyToMany</code> class can be reused anywhere it is suited. Even better would be to make <code>ManyToMany</code> an interface with many possible implementations.</p>
<p>I think my professor was wrong. The Java standard library contains many classes that are purely computational. Why can't application programmers write them as well? Further, look at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lisp0b-20">GOF Design Patterns Book</a>. Most (if not all) of the patterns are about abstracting computation, not &quot;objects in the real world&quot;. Take, for instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_responsibility_pattern">Chain-of-responsibility</a>, which Wikipedia describes as &quot;Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: look for repetitive patterns of code and build classes that take care of those patterns. Use those classes instead of repeating the pattern over and over in code.</p>
<p>One reason I like Clojure is that it has a lot to teach. If you'd like to learn Clojure, you might like my <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">Introduction to Clojure video course</a>.</p>

<p>As you probably know, I am running a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/376627045/lispcast-introduction-to-clojure-videos">Kickstarter project to create Introduction to Clojure videos</a>. The project is still going (it runs until March 14, 2013). Please support it if you want the videos.</p>
<p>I know that there are many great videos out there that teach the basics of Clojure. Allow me to present my selection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6S_1nCfjWA">Jim Slaterry is creating video walkthroughs</a> of the <a href="http://clojurekoans.com/">Clojure Koans</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/fulldisclojure">Full Disclojure was a long series of screencasts by Sean Devlin</a> that dives deep into Clojure. There are many lessons about Clojure and functional programming, screencasts explaining how to install editors, and a few explorations of katas. Most of the material should still be current.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoeav_T1ARU&amp;list=PLAC43CFB134E85266">Brian Will created a series of videos introducing Clojure</a> back in 2009 which explains the basics of the language. The basics have changed somewhat, but this is still a good way to get into the language.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGVqrGmwOAw">Rich Hickey</a> gave <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P76Vbsk_3J0">some talks</a> a long time ago teaching Clojure. Again, a little old, but I learned a lot from them when they were new.</p>

<p>Paul Chiusano:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real decrease in code size when using FP comes from there being exponentially more code reuse possible due to the compositionality of pure code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally agree. John Carmack has it wrong.</p>
