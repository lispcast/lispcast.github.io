<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Elena Machkasova is the next interview participant. She is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#emachkasova">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about adapting clojure to the classroom. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-elena-machkasova">background to her talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-elena-machkasova">Interview with Elena Machkasova</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How did you first learn Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: One of my students mentioned Clojure to me in 2009. It sounded really cool, so I included it in a class on functional programming for concurrency and was learning it partly in the summer before the course, and partly as the class was progressing.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What other languages are good for beginners or do you think clojure is the best?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: To alleviate possible confusion: I don't actually teach Clojure in a beginner-level class because there are currently no tools that would make this experience smooth for new students. I've taught Clojure as a part of a couple of upper-level courses where syntax isn't that much of an issue and students are experienced enough to deal with debugging in Clojure.</p>
<p>Beginner CS students need to focus on concepts, develop problem solving techniques, and learn to think in an abstract, modular, data-driven way. A solution needs to be developed as a series of short, clearly defined functions). A language that supports this process without getting students distracted by unnecessary details or unpredictable behavior would be a reasonable choice. Lisp languages, including Clojure, fit into this category. We currently use Racket ( a language in the Lisp family). Python is another appropriate first language. Statically typed languages, especially object-oriented ones (Java, C++), are too complex for beginners. Languages with complex interactions with memory or their environment (C, Javascript) are not a good choice either.</p>
<p>Since I haven't yet tried teaching a CS1 class with Clojure, I cannot say whether Clojure is &quot;the best&quot; (or even a reasonable) choice for beginners, but it certainly looks promising, assuming that it is made more beginner-friendly in terms of error messages and IDEs.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What types of applications do you like to use to teach your students? (i.e., a web app, console app, todo list, recipe list etc)</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: So far I mostly taught Clojure at upper level and we were mostly looking into concurrency. A beginner level class is focusing on concepts, but it has to have material that students are interested in as a small project part of the course. Possibilities include data processing and interactions with graphical libraries (animation, data visualization, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What clojure libraries do you like to use when teaching clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: We've been looking into incorporating Quil, especially the functional mode. I've also been looking into reducers for upper level courses. Expectations is a nice testing library, definitely worth including in any level course that uses Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Why would a Mars Rover would be better programmed in clojure be better than language <em>_</em> ?</p>
<p><strong>Elena</strong>: Immutable data -&gt; less possibility for error. Also, easy (i.e. less error-prone) approaches to concurrency would make large data processing fast and reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-luke-vanderhart">Interview with Luke VanderHart</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: I started using Clojure in 2008, shortly after its release. I had become interested in learning a Lisp, and since I was a Java programmer up to that point I was looking for one hosted on the JVM. Fortuitously, Clojure had just been released and so I found it and started playing with it.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What suggestions do you have for someone getting started with Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: Find the simplest editor that works for you, don't try to learn a new editor at the same time you're learning a new language. Don't worry about the more complex language features or libraries - just geting a good grasp of the basics (namespaces, data structures, functions, let-blocks, higher-order-functions) will give you 95% of the power of Clojure. The rest will come easily.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about the different incarnations of reactjs in clojure, what attracted you to it? Were you big into javascript before?</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: I am a long-time UI programmer and have worked with all kinds of user interfaces, from 3D games to Swing to HTML to various JS libraries. It's always been a frustrating experience. I am excited about React and its associated libraries because it's the first approach to UI development that strikes me as elegant and usable.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: About 11000 miles per second. Based on my latency to the REPL I'm running in a remote data center right now :)</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-ryan-neufeld">Interview with Ryan Neufeld</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: By my reckoning, I've been using Clojure professionally for about 2.5 years now.</p>
<p>How I got started is actually pretty interesting; I was hired by Cognitect (née Relevance) in early 2012 as a Ruby on Rails developer. Once the business shifted <em>hard</em> towards Clojure, I jumped at the first opportunity to get on with a Clojure client. My first Clojure project was with the most excellent Paul deGrandis, so it was a just a matter of letting osmosis take it's course. I haven't looked back since.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What suggestions do you have for someone getting started with clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Experiment liberally, and don't be afraid to make mistakes or &quot;do it wrong.&quot; A breadth of experience with the language and its libraries is crucial for knowing what tool to reach for when it is finally time to get down to business.</p>
<p>For those seeking to make the jump to full-time Clojure, a word of career advice: Never pass over a job opportunity because you lack on-paper experience. Every company wants to hire a Rich Hickey to work with them, but in most cases, they'd be more than happy with a bright, passionate developer such as yourself. Just give it a shot–at worst, you'll get a no, at best, you could change your life!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Your talk is about Simulation Testing, is there anything like this in other languages? If yes, what advantage does the implementation in clojure have over other languages?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Indeed there is. While Simulation Testing is novel to the Clojure community, it's been around for a number of years under various names; it's sometimes called model or agent-based testing, or just plain &quot;simulation.&quot; I heard from a little bird that organizations like DARPA use the technique on nearly all of their projects.</p>
<p>There are a couple of big benefits to doing Simulation Testing in Clojure, however. First and foremost is Simulant. In addition to being a useful framework for running Simulation Tests, the way it segregates tests into phases makes tests both reproducible and amenable to new validations that you can bring to bare against old sim runs.</p>
<p>The second superpower Clojure brings to the table is Datomic. Given Datomic is a time-based fact-store, it is a nearly perfect fit for long-term, continuous-integration style simulation testing. With Datomic, very few of the validations I write involve procedural code; generally a simple Datomic query will suffice to detect abnormalities. Even better, it is trivial to query how test results have change over time.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Well, the bird is a little slow to get off the ground (Clojure start times, and all), but once she's airborne you're looking at about 2-4 Rubies (that's 10 Javas, in the imperial system).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: I started playing with Clojure in late 2008—the fairly early days. It was interesting to me because I'd always heard that Lisp was amazing, but I'd never spent any time with one. Since Clojure runs on the JVM and has simple Java interop, it was far more accessible to me than any other Lisp. Since it was a new language and community, there seemed to be a lot of other people going through the same learning process I was, so the mailing list was very helpful. And back then it was low-traffic enough that I could actually keep up, which hasn't been the case for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: I'd been doing Ruby full-time for a few years before getting interested in Clojure—and continued to spend most of my time working in Ruby until 2012. Previous to that I'd done Java for about 5 years. Ruby really opened my eyes to how much power and expressiveness Java had been keeping from me. But after an exciting learning period with Ruby, I'd gotten a bit bored. Clojure came into my life at just the right time!</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Any suggestions for someone wanting to dive into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: That's a tough one. A background in Java and Ruby made it easy for me to deal with some of what can make Clojure difficult for newcomers: Java helped with the JVM, the API, and the ecosystem, while Ruby had already made me comfortable with strong but dynamic typing and some functional concepts. For someone with a similar background, I'd definitely recommend giving Clojure a try.</p>
<p>My advice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with tools you're comfortable with, rather than learning a tool you don't find intuitive while also learning a new language.</p></li>
<li><p>Start with a problem space you're familiar with, whether that's web, graphics, or data analysis, and find libraries that don't hide away too much magic.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the code! Lots of clojure.core and most other standard and contrib libraries are implemented in straightforward, idiomatic Clojure. Hopefully your tool of choice makes it seemless to jump into that code from your own. The only caveat with that advice is that sometimes—and it's not always obvious when this will happen—a library fn will be implemented in an unidiomatic way for reasons that aren't clear.</p></li>
<li><p>When in doubt, lean on the mailing list or IRC to find out from more experienced Clojurists whether what you're reading or writing is idiomatic or idiosyncratic code.</p></li>
<li><p>For someone with a different background, that advice might all be good, but there are probably aspects of the learning curve that I underestimate, so I'd recommend trying to find Clojurists with a similar background and getting their advice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-yoko-harada">Interview with Yoko Harada</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: My experience is quite sparse, but I've been using Clojure for about 4 years. Since I'm a JVM language lover, I had a great interest in Clojure, which was very different from other JVM languages. I started ClojureScript integrating Ruby gem at first.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: Mostly, Java and Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What are your thoughts on Clojure being a first language or do you think its more suited to someone who has some experience in programming?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: It depends. Thinking of the time I was a student, for some folks, lisp was the first language and did well using Lisp. For many people, Clojure coding is not similar to how they think. For example, in OOP, &quot;I have a cup of soup. let's add some spice&quot;, in Lisp, &quot;Let's add something and other stuff, what about soup and spice.&quot; Sometime, the latter is productive in coding while sometime, the former is. I admit OOP is natural for vast majority. But, at the same time, I don't think programming experience will help to think like Lisp.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What kinds of help do you need for ClojureBridge?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>spread the word</li>
<li>plan to organize ClojureBridge</li>
<li>have experiences of organizing, TAing, and others of ClojureBridge</li>
<li>involve yourself in ClojureBridge curriculum improvements based on the experience</li>
<li>become a ClojureBridge board member</li>
<li>become a ClojureBridge mentor and help people who firstly organize ClojureBridge</li>
<li>donate and support ClojureBridge financially. The workshop needs venue, some food and. sometime, coaches/TAs' travel expense</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is your favorite clojure library?</p>
<p><strong>Yoko</strong>: Hoplon</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/moocar">Anthony Marcar</a> generously agreed to do an interview about his <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#amarcar">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a>. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-anthony-marcar">background to the talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Marcar</strong>: About 4 years ago, I decided that java wasn’t cutting it for me. I needed a new language, but I wanted to be on the JVM. So Scala and Clojure were the obvious contenders. I decided to spend 3 months building an online card game in both languages to see which I liked more. Scala at first was easier to get into, whereas Clojure was thoroughly alien. But over time, In Scala, I found I was spending more time building abstract Type graphs and waiting for compiles to finish, whereas in Clojure I was having a lot of fun and moving faster. I also loved the emphasis on immutability in Clojure. After that I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Clojure is relatively new, so you don't really get many experience reports of large production systems. When you hear someone talking about Clojure who has used it maybe only hobby projects or small projects, what are the common things that strike you as untrue?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: I don’t know if &quot;untrue&quot; is the right way to put it, but things people generally haven’t thought about before embarking on larger Clojure projects are things like how do you deploy your application, how do you go about logging and monitoring? How do you protect your application from going down if downstream dependencies start timing out? And how do you grow a code base across multiple projects? There still aren’t many resources in the Clojure space to answer these kinds of questions.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Have you had experience bringing programmers who don't know Clojure onto your team? What were the challenges? What surprised you?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: Yes I have had rubyists, node.js and python people join the team. Not surprisingly the JVM was a big challenge. Things like the local maven repository, logging, and common java libraries can be hard to grasp. I was however surprised how easily everyone picked up on Clojure’s fundamentals such as immutability. I guess it’s because that’s what attracted them to the language in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Do you think Clojure is a good fit for large companies with lots of software?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: Clojure is great for large companies. I think it’s greatest asset is its focus on data structures. In big companies, this is a big deal as there are layers and layers of legacy systems, each with their own outdated data formats and protocols. Clojure's focus on data transformations and concurrency makes it perfect for working with many different services to produce the right business outcome. That, combined with the the fact that it runs on the JVM makes it perfect for large companies.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Do you have any advice for the folks out there working for big companies who want to introduce Clojure to their work?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: If you want to introduce Clojure at a large company, get ready for a very tough road ahead. Work from both the bottom and top of the organization. Try and find the engineers who are always looking at new technologies. The kind who get home and build side projects. Then infect them. At the same time, scour the organization for VPs, or SVPs who &quot;get&quot; technologists. Buy them a beer. Ask them to be a champion for you, to protect you every time a more &quot;traditional&quot; team tries to block your progress. You’ll need all the help you can get and will have to work well past your normal hours, but it’s worth it.</p>
<p>If you want to take a shortcut, build a company that does Clojure, and then get acquired by said big company ;)</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: All I would add is that working in Clojure is extremely fun. If you’re not already working in it full time, go and apply for a job somewhere where you can!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>AM</strong>: An ice cream sandwich. Because it’s awesome. That is all.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#lvanderhart">Luke Vanderhart's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about the ReactJS Landscape.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>ReactJS appeared from <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html">Facebook</a> last year in silence and without fanfare (from my view anyways!) but recent months has had an explosion on the web frameworks space, in particular in Clojure because of the common thread of immutablility running through the core concepts.</p>
<p>Since Facebook announced it in June, we have seen several incarnations of React in Clojure: <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om</a>, <a href="https://github.com/levand/quiescent">Quiescent</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent">Reagent</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>ReactJS is the View in MVC apps and is a declarative library for describing a user interface, it can figure out what parts of the application to redraw on an update. With the popularity of single page applciations this is key to making a fast and responsive user interface.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Brandon Bloom generously agreed to do an interview about his <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#bbloom">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a>. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-brandon-bloom">background to the talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Bloom</strong>: From 2009 to 2011, I encountered a couple of Rich's talks and writings. Each time I would look at Clojure briefly, but it never really clicked. When ClojureScript was released, my startup was heavily using CoffeeScript, so I decided to take a more serious peek at this new alternative. I immediately fell in love with Clojure and started contributing to ClojureScript. My startup never did get a chance to use ClojureScript, but Clojure on the JVM quickly became one of my favorite tools for prototypes and experiments, and I've lately, I've used it for <em>serious business</em> with some frequency.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: You will be talking about the CircleCI frontend, written in ClojureScript and Om. Om is less than 18 months old, and yet it is used in production systems and I assume replaced their previous frontend system. Can you speak to this decision? How was it evaluated?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: I honestly can't speak to the decision to use Om. That was made before I got involved. What I can say is that CircleCI was already a big Clojure user and their front end used to be CoffeeScript based. Daniel Woelfel deserves all the credit for choosing Om and delivering a production system with it. I got involved much later.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What were some of the challenges that you faced when developing with such a new library as Om?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Om is/was still evolving. It's got bugs, misfeatures, and other problems. Luckily, I've had the luxury of regular face time with David Nolen, Om's author, out at the Kitchen Table Coders studio in Brooklyn. I think that it's important for new library producers/consumers to interact regularly. Beyond that, the design patterns aren't established yet. It's difficult to simultaneously think deep thoughts about a challenging design space such as UI code, while also building a useful UI for your product. Sometimes, you just need to hack it and you can't be afraid to dig in to the library code while you're hacking it. After that, you need to reflect on whether your solution actually makes sense: Often it doesn't!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What are some improvements to Om you would like to see?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: That's a tough question to answer constructively, since David has already picked all of the low hanging fruit that I've pointed out to him. Overall, Om is an absolute delight. That said, it's clearly a first real attempt at the React style of UI development in Clojure. Some parts of Om, like cursors, just never made much sense. Other parts feel like missed opportunities to truly capitalize on ClojureScript's strengths. At this point, my feedback could be rolled in to notes for a second attempt at this style of UI framework in Clojure.</p>
<p>David has made the very pragmatic decision to assume React.js as a long term dependency. However, once you really get in to the weeds hacking on a UI, it becomes clear, at least it did to me, that less layers is always a good thing. Overall, a virtual DOM implementation is pretty easy, although getting it to perform well is tricky. I'd really like to see a ClojureScript library that drops the React.js dependency in favor of a more direct mapping to Clojure idioms.</p>
<p>The dichotomy between primitive elements and Om components (created via om/build) has got to go. It hurts modularity and refactorability. But I also don't particularly like some users' insistence on hiccup forms for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.circleci.com/local-state-global-concerns/">&quot;no local state&quot; descriptors</a> thing should definitely be <em>the only way</em> Om operate.</p>
<p>The &quot;world in an atom&quot; model isn't quite structured enough. We need something more database-like to manage client/server synchronization. Facebook's Relay is impressive and, if you squint right, their GraphQL looks a lot like Datomic's Pull API. I know that Sean Grove has been experimenting with a DataScript-backed UI. I think that somebody needs to ship a prescriptive framework here that integrates a client-side database with the view layer.</p>
<p>I've also got extensive notes for an alternative events system.</p>
<p>Beyond that, toolability is critical. The framework needs a way to design and test an individual component in the browser. You should have to go out of your way to break that, not go out of your way to enable it.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Gary Fredericks is the next interview participant. He is <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#gfredericks">giving a talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a> about Random number generation. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-gary-federicks">background to his talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-gary-fredericks">Interview with Gary Fredericks</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I started using Clojure in 2009 at my first full-time software job. The person I reported to was interested in experimenting with new languages.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I learned Clojure in parallel with Ruby, Erlang, and Scala; prior to that I had only programmed as a hobby (TI-BASIC and JavaScript, both due to platform monopoly), for undergrad CS classes (Java), and for a couple minor jobs (both with C++).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What editor do you use and what is a typical workflow?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I use emacs with cider, making heavy use of the repl and in-buffer evaluation (especially dedicated scratch files for more serious efforts). I also try to invest in improving my clojure environment via my leiningen profiles and a repl utilities library.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Can you describe a good use-case for Clojure that you see has an advantage over another language?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I think Clojure has a pretty general-purpose emphasis. The result is if you buy its value proposition you'll want to use it for a broad range of things, and if you don't you'll probably not want to use it for anything, as the cost of using a less popular language will be too high.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ time echo &#39;(System/exit 0)&#39; | java -jar clojure-1.6.0.jar
Clojure 1.6.0 user=&gt;
real 0m0.928s user 0m1.431s sys 0m0.053s</code></pre>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<h3 id="talk-no-strings-mobile-app-development-for-clojuretalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#zkim">No-strings mobile app development for Clojure</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#zkim">Zachary Kim's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about writing native mobile applications in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure on mobile is getting a lot of attention recently. ClojureScript has always allowed for WebKit development on the iPhone. Kevin Lynagh wrote <a href="http://theweathertron.com/">Weathertron</a>, released in June 2013, which used <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/angular-cljs-weather-app/">ClojureScript and Angular.js</a>. And more recently Mike Fikes has created an Objective-C/ClojureScript bridge called <a href="https://github.com/mfikes/goby">Goby</a>. And of course, there's a lot of excitement now about <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> and the ClojureScript workflow for using that. Mike Fikes is also working on a <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/ambly">ClojureScript REPL for iOS</a>. Zachary Kim does not give us any clues in the talk description, so we'll just have to make do with these.</p>
