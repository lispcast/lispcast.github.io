<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#lvanderhart">Luke Vanderhart's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about the ReactJS Landscape.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>ReactJS appeared from <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html">Facebook</a> last year in silence and without fanfare (from my view anyways!) but recent months has had an explosion on the web frameworks space, in particular in Clojure because of the common thread of immutablility running through the core concepts.</p>
<p>Since Facebook announced it in June, we have seen several incarnations of React in Clojure: <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om</a>, <a href="https://github.com/levand/quiescent">Quiescent</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent">Reagent</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>ReactJS is the View in MVC apps and is a declarative library for describing a user interface, it can figure out what parts of the application to redraw on an update. With the popularity of single page applciations this is key to making a fast and responsive user interface.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Brandon Bloom generously agreed to do an interview about his <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#bbloom">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West</a>. The <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/pre-west-brandon-bloom">background to the talk</a> is available, if you like.</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: How did you get into Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Bloom</strong>: From 2009 to 2011, I encountered a couple of Rich's talks and writings. Each time I would look at Clojure briefly, but it never really clicked. When ClojureScript was released, my startup was heavily using CoffeeScript, so I decided to take a more serious peek at this new alternative. I immediately fell in love with Clojure and started contributing to ClojureScript. My startup never did get a chance to use ClojureScript, but Clojure on the JVM quickly became one of my favorite tools for prototypes and experiments, and I've lately, I've used it for <em>serious business</em> with some frequency.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: You will be talking about the CircleCI frontend, written in ClojureScript and Om. Om is less than 18 months old, and yet it is used in production systems and I assume replaced their previous frontend system. Can you speak to this decision? How was it evaluated?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: I honestly can't speak to the decision to use Om. That was made before I got involved. What I can say is that CircleCI was already a big Clojure user and their front end used to be CoffeeScript based. Daniel Woelfel deserves all the credit for choosing Om and delivering a production system with it. I got involved much later.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What were some of the challenges that you faced when developing with such a new library as Om?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Om is/was still evolving. It's got bugs, misfeatures, and other problems. Luckily, I've had the luxury of regular face time with David Nolen, Om's author, out at the Kitchen Table Coders studio in Brooklyn. I think that it's important for new library producers/consumers to interact regularly. Beyond that, the design patterns aren't established yet. It's difficult to simultaneously think deep thoughts about a challenging design space such as UI code, while also building a useful UI for your product. Sometimes, you just need to hack it and you can't be afraid to dig in to the library code while you're hacking it. After that, you need to reflect on whether your solution actually makes sense: Often it doesn't!</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What are some improvements to Om you would like to see?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: That's a tough question to answer constructively, since David has already picked all of the low hanging fruit that I've pointed out to him. Overall, Om is an absolute delight. That said, it's clearly a first real attempt at the React style of UI development in Clojure. Some parts of Om, like cursors, just never made much sense. Other parts feel like missed opportunities to truly capitalize on ClojureScript's strengths. At this point, my feedback could be rolled in to notes for a second attempt at this style of UI framework in Clojure.</p>
<p>David has made the very pragmatic decision to assume React.js as a long term dependency. However, once you really get in to the weeds hacking on a UI, it becomes clear, at least it did to me, that less layers is always a good thing. Overall, a virtual DOM implementation is pretty easy, although getting it to perform well is tricky. I'd really like to see a ClojureScript library that drops the React.js dependency in favor of a more direct mapping to Clojure idioms.</p>
<p>The dichotomy between primitive elements and Om components (created via om/build) has got to go. It hurts modularity and refactorability. But I also don't particularly like some users' insistence on hiccup forms for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.circleci.com/local-state-global-concerns/">&quot;no local state&quot; descriptors</a> thing should definitely be <em>the only way</em> Om operate.</p>
<p>The &quot;world in an atom&quot; model isn't quite structured enough. We need something more database-like to manage client/server synchronization. Facebook's Relay is impressive and, if you squint right, their GraphQL looks a lot like Datomic's Pull API. I know that Sean Grove has been experimenting with a DataScript-backed UI. I think that somebody needs to ship a prescriptive framework here that integrates a client-side database with the view layer.</p>
<p>I've also got extensive notes for an alternative events system.</p>
<p>Beyond that, toolability is critical. The framework needs a way to design and test an individual component in the browser. You should have to go out of your way to break that, not go out of your way to enable it.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Where can people follow you online?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>:</p>

<li>http://www.brandonbloom.name/</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: If Clojure were a food, what food would it be?</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Certainly not a burrito.</p>

<h3 id="interview-with-gary-fredericks">Interview with Gary Fredericks</h3>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: How long have you been doing Clojure and how did you get into it?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I started using Clojure in 2009 at my first full-time software job. The person I reported to was interested in experimenting with new languages.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What languages did you do before Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I learned Clojure in parallel with Ruby, Erlang, and Scala; prior to that I had only programmed as a hobby (TI-BASIC and JavaScript, both due to platform monopoly), for undergrad CS classes (Java), and for a couple minor jobs (both with C++).</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What editor do you use and what is a typical workflow?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I use emacs with cider, making heavy use of the repl and in-buffer evaluation (especially dedicated scratch files for more serious efforts). I also try to invest in improving my clojure environment via my leiningen profiles and a repl utilities library.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Can you describe a good use-case for Clojure that you see has an advantage over another language?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>: I think Clojure has a pretty general-purpose emphasis. The result is if you buy its value proposition you'll want to use it for a broad range of things, and if you don't you'll probably not want to use it for anything, as the cost of using a less popular language will be too high.</p>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen Clojure REPL?</p>
<p><strong>Gary</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ time echo &#39;(System/exit 0)&#39; | java -jar clojure-1.6.0.jar
Clojure 1.6.0 user=&gt;
real 0m0.928s user 0m1.431s sys 0m0.053s</code></pre>
<p><strong>Nola</strong>: Thanks for the interview. It was very informative.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#zkim">Zachary Kim's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about writing native mobile applications in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure on mobile is getting a lot of attention recently. ClojureScript has always allowed for WebKit development on the iPhone. Kevin Lynagh wrote <a href="http://theweathertron.com/">Weathertron</a>, released in June 2013, which used <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/angular-cljs-weather-app/">ClojureScript and Angular.js</a>. And more recently Mike Fikes has created an Objective-C/ClojureScript bridge called <a href="https://github.com/mfikes/goby">Goby</a>. And of course, there's a lot of excitement now about <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> and the ClojureScript workflow for using that. Mike Fikes is also working on a <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/ambly">ClojureScript REPL for iOS</a>. Zachary Kim does not give us any clues in the talk description, so we'll just have to make do with these.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#ttallman">Tyler Tallman's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about how to model complex problems in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Medical care is incredibly complex, and is only getting worse. Most medical record software is like a basic CRUD app. It stores the information the doctor puts in and displays it when asked. But as the amount of information increases, something more needs to happen. How can the computer system support the doctor making ever more complex decisions? How can it support the host of medical professionals that provide care? And what role can Clojure play in that process?</p>
<p>I don't have any background information for this one. But I know Tyler personally and this is a fascinating story of rules engines, complex data formats, visualizations, and composable abstractions.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#tgardner">Timothy Gardner and Ramsey Nasser's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about <a href="http://arcadia-unity.tumblr.com/">Arcadia</a>, the integration of Clojure and Unity 3D.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>It took a lot of work to get Clojure running with Unity 3D. For one, Unity 3D is based on .NET, so the version of Clojure for the CLR had to be updated and retrofitted to work with it. But Unity 3D is a very popular game engine that exports to lots of major platforms, including consoles. This gives Clojure an inroad into even more systems. I've always wanted to program games, and this gives me hope that I'll do it one day.</p>
<p>For background, the two speakers have given several talks about Arcadia. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJr_TD1BtF0">Strange Loop 2014</a>, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHz5A19h9Z8">CodeMesh 2014</a>, and at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBvNIJzlWEI">Clojure NYC Meetup</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#sjohnson">Sean Johnson's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about pattern matching in Clojure.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>The built-in pattern matching in Clojure is not as powerful as in Haskell and Erlang. But, being a Lisp, it's easy to write a pattern matching macro. Which has been done, it's called <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.match">core.match</a>, and it's great. This talk is an experience report from using pattern matching in Clojure. Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/27860102">Pattern Matching &amp; Predicate Dispatch</a>, a talk by core.match's creator, David Nolen.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>People are using Clojure for some really interesting work. This one is about using Excel as an output format. It's richer by far than CSV, and it can let non-programmers explore data in a way no other tool can. Tom Faulhaber has created a library for filling in Excel templates with Clojure data. See <a href="http://www.infolace.com/blog/2015/02/10/generating-beautiful-excel-reports-with-templates/">his blog post</a> for more info.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#rtoland">Ron Toland's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about large-scale Clojure systems.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I detect a theme in the Clojure/West talks. Clojure has been around almost eight years now. We're starting to see companies that have mature Clojure codebases. And they are wanting to talk about them.</p>
<p>This talk seems to go with that theme. Sonian has been using Clojure for six years and they want to share how they build their services. As background, I have to again suggest <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/2863-real-world-clojure">Reflections on a real-world Clojure application</a>. Unfortunately, there isn't much out there right now. I am very much looking forward to these talks being published.</p>
