<p>Simply amazing.</p>
<p>I tried to build a small project using ClojureScript and gave up, reverting back to Javascript. The workflow was awkward and information about the language was lacking. ClojureScript One aims to exemplify the power latent in ClojureScript by giving us a productive workflow from the very start. You clone the repo and use it as a starting point for your own project.</p>
<p>I haven't explored this new project, but it is already impressive. It sets a high bar for new projects. It includes a well-designed home page, getting started videos, and nice documentation. But, more importantly, it hints at a new age in web development in much the same way as the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY"><em>Blog in 15 Minutes</em></a> Ruby on Rails video ushered in the rise of Ruby on the web. Watch the ClojureScript One Getting Started video to have your mind blown.</p>
<p>I also recommend a <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2012/01/12/podcast-episode-003.html">podcast</a> about the goals of ClojureScript One.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, you are probably a programmer. Let me ask you, for just a moment, to step out of your programmer shoes and answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this apple equal to that orange?</li>
<li>Is that cloud equal to this house?</li>
<li>Is my backpack equal to my television?</li>
</ul>
<p>The obvious answer is &quot;no&quot; to all of these. And so (please step back into your programmer shoes) we see in many languages I can ask a similar question:</p>
<p>In Java:</p>
<pre><code>apple.equals(orange)</code></pre>
<p>Or in Clojure:</p>
<pre><code>(= apple orange)</code></pre>
<p>The answer to both questions is unsurprisingly <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>And in Haskell?</p>
<pre><code>apple == orange</code></pre>
<p>Type error! The compiler is saying I cannot even ask the question.</p>
<p>What model of reality is Haskell asserting?</p>
<p>Is it telling me that I need to convert the apple and orange into values of the same type?</p>
<pre><code>Fruit {name = &quot;apple&quot;} == Fruit {name = &quot;orange&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>Is this question really different from <code>apple == orange</code>?</p>
<p>Which model (Haskell's or Clojure's) more closely models reality?</p>
<p>Is this behavior intentionally designed into Haskell or is it incidental behavior due to the choice of type system?</p>
<p>Does this behavior make Haskell better or worse than a hypothetical Haskell that allowed the question to be asked?</p>
<p>Deep questions.</p>

<p>Paul Chiusano:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the functional programming world, there is insane amounts of code reuse happening, but along with this comes a fair bit of plumbing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>plumbing</em> Chiusano is referring to is incidental complexity imposed by current static type systems without a good set of &quot;universal&quot; types. Dynamically typed languages often do not have the same plumbing problem because of the extra information available at runtime to do dynamic dispatching and the use of overloading. This incidental complexity is a huge hurdle to languages like Haskell, where half of the code is about converting from one type to another.</p>
<p>This could be the fault of the codebase/libraries I am working with. In my practical Haskell experience, I have failed to find the zen of type/domain fit that static-typing enthusiasts talk about. Chiusano, however, hints that this problem is universal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes it clear that types are effective not just at preventing many software errors, but also in <em>guiding development</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would love to see the adoption of standard type classes recognized by the Haskell compiler that could automatically handle the most common coercions safely. For instance, the compiler could &quot;upgrade&quot; function application to Functor application when the types match. It is beyond me whether this can be done &quot;safely&quot;. I suspect that it cannot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second is to have more normalized types and type systems so that there is no incidental structure for code to broker between in the first place. To support this we'll see things like row types, unordered tuples, type sets, and so on, and any related type system machinery needed to make all this feasible and convenient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If modules were programmed to a small, standard set of types (and type classes), they would be more universally applicable. The compiler could &quot;overload&quot; functions automatically. The trick is to keep it safe. At the very least, the &quot;universal&quot; types would help programmers do it manually. We may already be seeing such a convergence.</p>
<p>Not coincidentally, the built in Clojure data structures are usually all I need. Others appear to think the same. The Clojure ecosystem thrives from the consensus on a small, universal set. There is a lot of reuse and little boilerplate.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a> as an example of a universal datatype facilitating a flourishing community. It allows the problem domain (web programming) to be broken up into subproblems with little-to-no coordination between the groups. Clojure has a number of web frameworks and libraries that are all inter-compatible. I think this is unique among languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The editor will search for a program to make the types align, show me the program for confirmation if I request it, and then not show this subexpression in the main editor view . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please give me this editor. It is technically feasible. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/">Hoogle</a> can already do a pretty decent search based on the types of functions. All you need is a planner to find a path from one type to another.</p>
<p>You could even help the search by defining a type class <code>Convertible</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Convertible a b where
    convert :: a -&gt; b</code></pre>
<p>All of the instances of <code>Convertible</code> would form graphs which could be searched for all paths between any two types. The editor could show a list of those paths and let you choose one.</p>

<p>A great Alan Kay-esque speech (by none other than Alan Kay himself).</p>
<p>Alan Kay is a great thinker and I always enjoy his talks, but he needs someone to refine his presentations--particularly his verbal explanations. There are lots of great ideas and perspectives, but mostly he is just saying that &quot;we're doing it wrong&quot;. Much better would be to show us his analysis of a problem.</p>
<p>In general, I finish his presentations feeling like everyone is doing everything wrong but with no concrete steps to take to correct it. We are thinking wrong (we need better perspectives), we are programming wrong, we are engineering wrong, we are learning the wrong things, we are doing computer science wrong, etc.</p>
<p>I also finish thinking that a new and better way is possible, but again, with no idea of that better way except a vague notion of less and better code in less time.</p>
<p>And then here I am, trapped in a world of crappy computers and crappy thinking, with a feeling of unease. I wish he would come down to Earth a little and apply that big brain with its great perspectives to a problem on-camera. It would be concrete and I could learn to emulate his thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inspired by Clojure's multimethods, multimethod.js provides a functional alternative to classical, prototype based polymorphism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KrisJordan/multimethod-js">multimethod.js</a> builds functions which dispatch on arbitrary predicates in Javascript using a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">fluent style</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multimethod iterates through each 'method' registered with <code>when</code> and performs an equality test on the <code>dispatchValue</code> and each method's match value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder whether a linear search for the dispatch value will scale. I prefer to see some kind of hash-map based solution. Is it possible to serialize the object to JSON and use the resulting String as a key?</p>
<p>Still, I enjoy seeing inter-language cross-pollination. It is also a nice translation from a functional language to a prototype language. The fluent interface does the job extremely well.</p>

<p>Clojure is a LISP dialect; if you have ever been forced to use LISP in a computer science class, I understand your resistance towards this class of totally functional languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I appreciate his honesty here. Universities have traditionally used Lisp to teach functional programming. They often neglect to mention that mosts Lisps are <em>not</em> purely functional. In fact, they lie to the students in the name of pedagogy. People leave Programming Languages class with many false notions about Lisp.</p>

<p>In fact, LISP for many of us means lots of Reverse Polish Notation where (+ 1 2) evaluates to three; absence of for cycles <em>[loops]</em> and other commodities to privilege tail recursion; and absolute lack of state in the form of variables (the state isn't really absent: I've seen it on the stack.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish notation</a>, the same expression would be <code>(2 1 +)</code>. Lisp uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">Polish notation</a>, otherwise known as Prefix notation.</p>
<p>Common Lisp, in fact, has <em>more loops than Java</em>. Java has <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and the sadder <code>do..while</code> loops. Common Lisp's <code>loop</code> macro alone trumps any other language I know for <em>imperative</em> and <em>stateful</em> iteration. In addition to <code>loop</code>, Common Lisp defines <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_dotime.htm"><code>dotimes</code></a>, <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_dolist.htm"><code>dolist</code></a>, <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_do_do.htm"><code>do</code></a>, <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_do_do.htm"><code>do*</code></a> (a variation on <code>do</code>), and the loops for symbols in a package <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_do_sym.htm"><code>do-symbols</code></a>, <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_do_sym.htm"><code>do-external-symbols</code></a>, and <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_do_sym.htm"><code>do-all-symbols</code></a>.</p>
<p>The fact that a non-lisper believes something about Lisp so false yet so common hints that something is very wrong. The misconception &quot;absolute lack of state in the form of variables&quot; will be familiar to many Lisp programmers who talk to non-lispers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Download and unzip the last release of Clojure. Start up a class by specifying clojure-1.3.0.jar in the classpath :</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    java -cp clojure-1.3.0.jar clojure.main</code></pre>
<p>It's nice that Clojure is so easy to run.</p>
<p>Again, thumbs up to Giorgio for finishing a kata in a new language. Keep up with the Clojure!</p>

<p>This is a cautionary tale set in a dystopian Lisp where <code>nil</code> is not false and false is not <code>nil</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I went back to the master and appealed once again<br /> I said, pardon me, but now I’m really insane<br /> He said, no you’re not really going out of your head<br /> Instead of just <code>VAL</code>, you must use <code>NOT NULL</code> instead</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>nil</code> means (traditionally) false, the empty list, and also &quot;no value&quot;. In my opinion, Lisp has hit a sweet spot. Somehow, <code>nil</code> overloading makes for succinct programs.</p>
<p>It's possible to go overboard and do this wrong. Case in point: <a href="http://www.mapbender.org/JavaScript_pitfalls:_null,_false,_undefined,_NaN">the problems with boolean values and comparison in Javascript</a>.</p>
