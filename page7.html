<p>Summary: <em><code>conj</code> can be confusing if you're used to other languages. It is not a commonly defined operation. Most languages define common positional adding operations. <code>conj</code>, however, has more useful semantics. How do you use <code>conj</code> usefully if you can't guarantee the position?</em></p>
<p>When I was at university, we were taught object-oriented programming as it exists in Java. We learned about interfaces, inheritance, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle"><em>Liskov Substitution Principle</em></a>. It makes sense. If you're claiming that you've got a (sub)type of car, <strong>it still has to do everything a car can do</strong>. Otherwise it's not really a subtype of car.</p>
<h3 id="the-point-of-confusion">The point of confusion</h3>
<p>Whenever I'm teaching someone Clojure, there's <strong>a point in the journey where everyone gets at least curious</strong>, if not outright confused.</p>
<pre><code>(conj &#39;(1 2 3) 4) ;;=&gt; &#39;(4 1 2 3)</code></pre>
<p>vs</p>
<pre><code>(conj [1 2 3] 4) ;;=&gt; [1 2 3 4]</code></pre>
<p>What's the deal? <strong>Does <code>conj</code> add to the beginning or the end?</strong> What possible contract could allow both of these behaviors?</p>
<p>Then I show them that the confusion goes even deeper:</p>
<pre><code>(conj #{1 2 3} 4) ;;=&gt; #{1 4 2 3} ;; or some other random order</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>(conj {1 2 3 4} [5 6]) ;;=&gt; {1 2 3 4 5 6}</code></pre>
<p>What gives? How is this even possible? <strong>Do hashmaps and linked lists even share a common class ancestor?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is, <em>sure, if you want them to</em>. The student must get over a tiny conceptual bump. And once that bump is surmounted, poof, a new way of seeing is discovered.</p>
<h3 id="the-bump">The bump</h3>
<p>Let's get over that bump right here, right now.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a traditional collection interface, let's call it <code>List</code>. It has two methods, <code>addFirst</code> and <code>addLast</code> that add new elements. So you write an algorithm that adds a bunch of items to the end with <code>addLast</code>. It takes a <code>List</code> as argument, because that's <strong>the least subtype you need to perform the algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>You call that algorithm with an <code>ArrayList</code>, which has the nice property that <code>addLast</code> is constant time. Woohoo! <strong>Your algorithm is fast and great.</strong></p>
<p>A few months later, you get a phone call from another developer. He's complaining that he used your routine and can't figure out why it's so slow. It was working fine for a while, but <strong>as the users generated more records in the database</strong>, the routine was grinding to a hault.</p>
<p>You check out the code and immediately see the problem: the database query was returning not an <code>ArrayList</code> but a <code>LinkedList</code>. The implementation of <code>addLast</code> on <code>LinkedList</code>s is actually linear. <strong>Adding a bunch of stuff to the end was turning into a quadratic operation.</strong></p>
<p>Let's say that again: even though the location semantics of the operation were the same, <code>addLast</code> on one had constant time and on the other had linear time. They both gave equivalent lists, but one of them was too slow. <strong>Does this satisfy the Liskov Substitution Principle?</strong> In practice, can you <em>really</em> substitute one for the other? <strong>Algorithmic complexity matters.</strong></p>
<p>Clojure avoids that mess (while swapping it for another, which I'll get to shortly). It defines <code>conj</code>, which means not &quot;put this at the beginning&quot; or &quot;put this at the end&quot;, but &quot;hey, collection, you know yourself better than I ever can. Please add this wherever it makes sense for you as long as you <strong>do it in constant time</strong>. Thanks.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Practically, that means that <code>conj</code> on <code>LinkedList</code> adds to the front, because that's constant time. And <code>conj</code> on <code>ArrayList</code> adds to the end. But, because the operation doesn't talk about order, like <code>addFirst</code> and <code>addLast</code> do, you can now extend <code>conj</code> to <code>Set</code> and even <code>Map</code> if you consider key/value pairs as single items. And that means that linear algorithms using <code>conj</code> will <strong>remain linear regardless of which collection you use</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-mess-that-clojure-chooses-over-the-other-mess">The mess that Clojure chooses over the other mess</h3>
<p>Does this satisfy the Liskov Substitution Principle? Well, that depends on how you look at it. You certainly <strong>don't guarantee that you get the same or even equivalent answers out</strong>. Consider this:</p>
<pre><code>(def a [1 2 3])
(def b &#39;(1 2 3))

(= a b) ;;=&gt; true
(= (conj a 4) (conj b 4)) ;;=&gt; false</code></pre>
<p>So, here, performing the same operation on two equal values does not give equal results. That's kind of hard to reason about. <strong>But it's a similar tradeoff that you see with other operations that don't guarantee order.</strong> For instance, imagine two sets <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>(= a b) ;;=&gt; true

(= (seq a) (seq b)) ;;=&gt; could be false!</code></pre>
<p>The order of most sets is not guaranteed! This means that Clojure has some operations that do not maintain equality. <code>conj</code> just happens to be one of them.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-point">What's the point?</h3>
<p>So Clojure does not provide <code>add</code> operations that guarantee order regardless of collection type. Fine. What's the point?</p>
<p>The point is that, in practice, <code>conj</code> is more useful than <code>addFirst</code> and <code>addLast</code> combined. By defining a function using <code>conj</code>, <strong>it will work on a broader number of collections</strong>. It might give different answers for each, but it won't explode on one and do fine on the rest. And often <strong>the answers it gives are just fine</strong>. A basic version of <code>into</code> can be defined very easily. It works on all collections (for both <code>to</code> and <code>from</code>).</p>
<pre><code>(defn into [to from]
  (reduce conj to from))</code></pre>
<h3 id="common-usage">Common usage</h3>
<p>One last thing before I wrap up: because the <em>collection itself</em> defines where the item will be added, I often find myself choosing the collection based on where I need it. A common idiom in Common Lisp was to make a new list by <code>cons</code>ing onto the front, then reversing it at the end because you really wanted them in the other order. In Clojure, there's no need, because you can just use a vector (and use <code>conj</code>). <strong>As long as the vector is local to the algorithm, it's not part of the contract, so it's your choice.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Java was wrong. <code>addFirst</code> and <code>addLast</code> cannot be substituted in <code>LinkedList</code> and <code>ArrayList</code>. They have <strong>different algorithmic complexities</strong> and at some point one's performance will be totally unacceptable. The operation that <em>does</em> allow for substitutibility in algorithm complexity is <code>conj</code>, which is always constant time. But then it doesn't maintain equality. However, I find that <code>conj</code> is way more natural and helps algorithmic reasoning more than guaranteeing <em>where</em> the item is placed.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn Clojure, I recommend my video course <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure"><em>LispCast Introduction to Clojure</em></a>. It's a great introduction to the language using animations, exercises, and screencasts. It's designed to give a deep dive straight to what makes Clojure interesting. It begins with syntax, goes through functional programming, and ends with data-driven programming.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#echeran">Elango Cheran's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about writing Clojure in other spoken languages.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I once heard someone from Poland say that they didn't mind so much that programming languages are mostly English-based. They compared it to classical music, where most terms are adapted from Italian. It's just part of learning the craft.</p>
<p>That said, making basic English a pre-requisite is a huge burden for the would-be programmer. Being able to write code using terms from your own language and characters from your own language could go a long way to making programming more accessible. Elango claims that Clojure is well-suited for the task because it has macros. That's intriguing.</p>
<p>Read his blog post about using <a href="http://www.elangocheran.com/blog/2014/10/exploring-programming-in-thamil-not-english-through-clojure/">unicode characters in Clojure</a>. It introduces <a href="https://github.com/echeran/clj-thamil">clj-thamil</a>, a library for wrapping built-in Clojure with Thamil equivalents.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#bhauman">Bruce Haumans's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about Figwheel, his tool for compiling and auto-reloading ClojureScript in the browser.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>One of the characteristics of web development is that it is highly dependent on visual feedback. The various languages are loose enough in their semantics that it is hard to verify their correctness past how they look. Typically, you write some code then reload the browser to see the changes.</p>
<p>This can work, but each time you reload, you lose all of the Javascript state in the browser, which can make each change take a long time. Each time you reload, you have to reinstatiate the state, either manually or automatically. Figwheel solves this problem in a different way: whenever your ClojureScript file changes, recompile it and push it to the browser (over WebSockets). If you set the ClojureScript up right, your state will be preserved.</p>
<p>I have used Figwheel and it absolutely changes ClojureScript development. It's one of the first things I set up in a new ClojureScript project. This talk will explain how to work it into your workflow.</p>
<p>Read this <a href="http://rigsomelight.com/2014/05/01/interactive-programming-flappy-bird-clojurescript.html">introductory blogpost about Figwheel</a> with a demo video.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#bbloom">Brandon Bloom's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about Om in production.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>It's hard to believe, but Om was actually started in December 2013. That's just 16 months ago. There hasn't been a lot of time for companies to explore it in production. Brandon Bloom helped build <a href="http://circleci.com">CircleCI</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/circleci/frontend">ClojureScript and Om frontend</a>, which is now open source. This will be a wonderful glimpse into the challenges and advantages of Om in a production system.</p>
<p>At last year's Clojure/West, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtwq3QtddY">David Nolen introduced Om and the design decisions behind it</a>. And more recently at React.js Conf 2015, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hGHdETNteE">David Nolen went a bit deeper</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#amarcar">Anthony Marcar's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about how to build larger Clojure applications.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Clojure was released in 2007. That means it's coming up on 8 years. It is also a powerful language for parallel computations, like we see in Cascalog and Storm. As big data has become more popular, Clojure's ease with processing lots of information has given it a great role to play recently. It came about at just the right time to take advantage of the big data boom. Several large companies acquired smaller Clojure companies, including Walmart, Staples, and Twitter. And because Clojure runs on the JVM, it's perfect for the enterprise. But we don't have many experience reports about how they have learned to use it.</p>
<p>Anthony Marcar works at Walmart using Clojure. I'm sure there will be some great information in this talk. I don't know specifically what it will be about, but it might be interesting to contrast it with <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/2863-real-world-clojure">Reflections on a real-world Clojure application</a>, a talk by Malcolm Sparks.</p>

<h3 id="talk-boot-can-build-ittalk">Talk: <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#adipert">Boot Can Build It</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#adipert">Alan Dipert and Micha Niskin's talk</a> at <em>Clojure/West</em> is about how Boot can be used as a build system for your projects.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>The main project tool in the Clojure community is <a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>. In Leiningen, you write a project's configuration using a declarative syntax. In order to add build actions, you generally have to add plugins, which also need to be configured.</p>
<p><a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a> takes a different approach, which is to code everything in Clojure. Boot is just a library and you script builds similar to how you might do so with shell scripts or Make, but you're in Clojure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XQD89enjE">Micha at Boston Clojure Group</a> (Youtube)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/boot-clj/">Boot, the Fancy New Clojure Build Framework</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boot is like the lisped-up lovechild of Git and Unix in that it provides abstractions that make it much more pleasant to write code that exists at the intersection of your operating system and your application.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h4>
<p>Builds and deployments are getting more complex. A tool needs to be able to build a Docker container, push to Heroku, tag a release, spin up a server, etc. Can a tool built around declarative configuration and plugins keep up? The creators of Boot say the answer is &quot;no&quot;. Boot's approach is different from Leiningen's, and so is not competing head-on, and yet still fills a need. Also, Boot's branding and developer pedigree seem to put it on firm foundation. There could be room for a second project tool. If there is, it will likely be Boot.</p>
