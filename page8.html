<p>Summary: <em>LispCast video courses have a new, interactive format. It's easier for me to make courses (read: more, faster) and it's a better experience for learners.</em></p>
<p>I've released <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/">3 Clojure LispCast video courses</a>. They've been selling okay (many thanks to my beautiful buyers and other supporters!), but I need more videos to bring it to a full time wage. After it took 9 months to do the <code>core.async</code> videos<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, I decided to take a step back and <strong>optimize my process</strong>.</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to do was to be able to <strong>generate the videos programmatically</strong>. Editing video takes a long time, and I knew that most of what I did during editing was automatable. That would eliminate hours of work per hour of video.</p>
<p>I began coding up some <strong>routines to compose videos functionally</strong> (inspired by the <a href="http://conal.net/papers/">functional animation work by Conal Elliott</a>). It worked really well. I could code up simple animations, concatenate videos, and rerender a preview very quickly. This combined with the Emacs Lisp scripts I have for automatically recording the &quot;typing&quot; portions of the videos, I was ready to code up the video.</p>
<p>But I eventually scrapped the idea. <strong>Nothing wrong with the idea, but I found something better.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/rubygeek">Nola Stowe</a> suggested I make the video course viewable in a browser. That means I have HTML and Javascript. Not only does it let me have a bit of interactivity (such as pausing at the right place automatically), it also enhances the experience a lot. Table of contents, links, smaller download, etc. So I got to work on an in-browser course.</p>
<p>I'm working on the next LispCast course, in the new format. It's already way faster to make, and the viewer experience is amazing. It combines video, interactive exercises, animations, and more into one package. I can't wait to show the world. I've got a lot of great things to announce soon, so <strong>sign up below</strong> to get updates as they come out.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>Ring, the Clojure Web library, defines three main concepts that you use to construct web applications.</em></p>
<p>Ring is the center of the Clojure web universe. It's not the only option in town, but the other options refer to Ring to say how they are different. <strong>Understanding Ring will help you learn any other web system in Clojure.</strong></p>
<p>Ring has three main concepts that work together to build a web application.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adapters</li>
<li>Handlers</li>
<li>Middleware</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="adapters">Adapters</h3>
<center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/adapters.jpg" />
</center>

<p>I like to think of Ring Adapters as plug adapters. When you go to a different continent, you often have to adapt the holes in the electical outlet to fit your cords. Ring Adapters let you convert different web server implementations into a standard Ring Request/Response format. That way, all of your code is standardized to the Ring format. <strong>Your code can travel into any kind of server as long as an adapter exists.</strong></p>
<p>There are Ring Adapters for many existing servers.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring-httpcore-adapter">Apache HttpCore</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And more.</p>
<h3 id="handlers">Handlers</h3>
<center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/handler.png" />
</center>

<p>Handlers do the work of your application. They are like the computer. They are just Clojure functions. HTTP is basically a request/response protocol that maps well to functions, which are just a protocol from argument to return value. <strong>Handlers take a Ring Request and return a Ring Response.</strong> They should do whatever logic is necessary for your application.</p>
<h3 id="middleware">Middleware</h3>
<center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/middleware.jpg" />
</center>

<p>Middleware are the voltage converters. Here in North America, wall sockets run at 120 volts, which is different from almost everywhere. In order to run an appliance from elsewhere, you not only need to adapt the socket, you also need to transform the current to a compatible voltage. <strong>Middleware are often used to convert the incoming request in some standard way.</strong> For instance, there is middleware to parse a JSON body into a Clojure map and store it away in the request.</p>
<p>The transformer also &quot;cleans up&quot; the current. Voltage spikes are evened out so they never get to the computer. <strong>Middleware can similarly protect a handler by making sure the browser is logged in.</strong></p>
<p>The analogy kind of breaks down, because middleware can do work (like the computer). Middleware are the hardest part of the Ring idea. They're not hard because the concept is hard. They're hard because <strong>they require design decisions</strong>. If all you had were Adapters and Handlers, you wouldn't have to think about where to put your logic. It would all go in the Handlers.</p>
<p>But there would be a lot of duplicated logic in your handlers. <strong>Authentication, routing, content-type switching, all of these things are done the same way over and over.</strong> It's the perfect problem for a little higher order programming. That's essentially what Middleware is.</p>
<p>Ring Middleware are functions that take a Handler and return a new Handler. Since Handlers are functions, <strong>Middleware are higher-order functions</strong>. The transformer on your computer's power cord takes a machine that requires a certain current and turns it into a machine that takes a different current. Middleware are used to do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>So, for instance, there's a Middleware called <a href="https://github.com/magnars/prone">Prone</a> that captures exceptions in the Handler and displays them in a nice format. Prone is a function that takes a Handler and returns a new Handler that catches exceptions and returns a different Ring Response in that case. Or you have Middleware that handle session cookies. <strong>The Middleware take a Handler and return a new Handler that understands sessions.</strong></p>
<p>My recommendation for what to put in Middleware versus what to put in Handlers is simplest to explain with a graph.</p>
<center>
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/handler-middleware.png" />
</center>

<p>Along the x-axis, we have logic that ranges from HTTP logic (handling header values, query params, etc.) to business logic (which bank account to withdraw from). Along the y-axis, we have how unique the logic is, ranging from highly duplicated to custom. <strong>These are the two axes I use to figure out whether it should be in the Handler or the Middleware.</strong></p>
<p>The clear cases are easy. In the upper right corner (red dot), where it's custom business logic, <strong>it's definitely in the Handler</strong>. In the lower left (blue dot), where it's duplicated HTTP logic, I prefer Middleware. <strong>The hard part is in the middle.</strong> Somewhere between those two, there's a fine line where a <strong>case-by-case decision is required</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Ring is great because it requires so few concepts to capture so much of HTTP. But it's not everything. Standard Ring does not support WebSockets, for instance. Small adaptations are necessary. In general, I think this is a great abstraction. <strong>And Ring is so central to Clojure on the Web, it's important to know.</strong></p>

              Object-Oriented Programming is the Dual of Functional Programming
            </a>
          </h2>

          <div class="timestamp">
            February 08, 2015
          </div>

          
<p>Summary: <em>Object-Oriented Programming is often shown in contrast to Functional Programming. But they are so exactly opposite that they are duals, and so equivalent in important ways. Which one to use should be left up to the programmer, as is done in Clojure and Javascript.</em></p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at programming from an interesting perspective. Let's say that programs are divided into <em>code</em> and <em>data</em>. <sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> <strong>These are the two main axes</strong>: structuring code and structuring data.</p>
<p>Now, let's design a language. First decisions: <strong>which axis is primary, which is secondary</strong>?</p>
<center>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Style</th>
<th align="left">Data</th>
<th align="left">Code</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">OOP</td>
<td align="left">Primary</td>
<td align="left">Secondary</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">FP</td>
<td align="left">Secondary</td>
<td align="left">Primary</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>

<p>In an OOP-style approach, we have <strong>a pointer to an object which is the <em>data</em></strong>. And the data also tells you where the <em>code</em> is to access it (methods in the vtable). An FP-style approach will make <strong>functions (<em>code</em>) primary</strong>, with <em>data</em> referred to by the closures (the captured lexical environment).</p>
<p>I'm positive I'm not the first person to remark on this, but I think it's pretty cool that <strong>they are duals of each other</strong>. <strong>A simple transformation will switch one in the table with the other.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the next obvious question is &quot;which one is better?&quot;. Many arguments about OOP vs FP focus on this choice, about which axis should be primary. Because a compiler could easily transform between them, the decision is not quite so important as we might think at first. I think that <strong>a language should make both available and let the programmer choose</strong>. The programmer is then free to choose whichever best models the problem.</p>
<p>For instance, in Clojure, fns are closures, so they are really FP-style -- code meant to be executed which happens to refer to some data. But collections are data which refer to code which knows how to access the data. <strong>Both coexist quite cooperatively.</strong></p>
<p>And <strong>Clojure gives you, the programmer, ways of expressing both styles</strong>. When you want to create some code to be executed, <code>fn</code> lets you define lexical closures. But sometimes you want to make a new data structure which acts like others. For instance, a new type of sequence. <code>deftype</code> lets you define data with interface and protocol implementations. I use both <code>fn</code> and <code>deftype</code> very often.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <strong>Javascript gives you these two options as well.</strong> <code>function</code> defines lexical closures, making code primary. But very often you define an object which contains (or refers to) data and secondary accessor functions. It's one of the nicer things about Javascript, included in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596517742">Javascript, the Good Parts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How does your language prioritize these two axes?</strong> Is there a way to choose which to use to best implement your design? If you're interested in this kind of topic, you would probably enjoy the <a href="http://www.clojuregazette.com/">Clojure Gazette</a>.

<p>Summary: <em>I am looking for more sponsors for the Clojure Gazette and I need your help.</em></p>
<p>I have some big plans for the Clojure Gazette this year.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the Clojure Gazette is the only Clojure-focussed newsletter out there<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. It's usually a collection of links to material I think would interest and educate people interested in Clojure. It's not always directly about Clojure. But Clojurists seem to be <strong>interested in a variety of things</strong>. Sometimes the issue is based around a strong theme, like Haskell or Object Oriented Programming. And sometimes it is an interview. This year, I'd like to do more themed issues are more interviews.</p>
<p>I think it <strong>plays an important part in the community</strong>. I have interviewed the Google Summer of Code participants for a couple of years now. The interviews let the community know what they were working on and what progress they had made. And some of the themed issues got the most positive commentary I've ever received. People seem to want to learn and to have existing information organized for them.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the Clojure Gazette takes a lot of work to put out each week. There are over 3,200 subscribers now, and it's growing every day. In July 2014, I began inviting sponsors to <strong>purchase a placement in issues of the Gazette</strong>. I've had a few generous sponsors contact me, which got me a few months of sponsorship.</p>
<p>The sponsorships have been a success, in different ways. One job advertisement got hundreds of clicks and valuable exposure to a company that is just beginning to use Clojure. Others brought qualified visitors to developer-related services. I'm very greatful to Clojure/conj, which bought a placement. <strong>It is a big vote of confidence when the official Clojure conference asks to put their logo in your newsletter.</strong></p>
<p>Now I am trying to be more active to find the sponsors. The goals for the Gazette are modest. None of them require any more money, just more time and work, and a little more organization. But the total time input is significant. With a small amount of funding, <strong>I'll be able to justify increasing the quality of the Gazette</strong>. I've always thought it would become a business one day. Putting money on the line always makes things more crisp and professional.</p>
<p>Now is where I ask for a favor. If you can spare a few moments, would you please think about whether you get value from the Gazette and what you can do to <strong>send some sponsors my way</strong>. It may be contacting the hiring department at your company and suggesting a paid job listing. Or it could be experimenting with selling your company's service to the thousands of smart Clojure programmers subscribed to the newsletter. Or maybe you just want to show your appreciation and get some good karma in the community. I appreciate all help. Get in touch by <script type="text/javascript">

<p>Summary: <em>Writing software alone and in a long term sustainable manner requires a lot of discipline. Upfront planning and avoidance of feature creep can turn a stressful project into a pleasure.</em></p>
<p><em>UPDATE: I originally wrote this piece back in 2010. I was recently reminded of it and thought it would be good to revive this article from my old blog.</em></p>
<h3 id="a-guide-for-the-solo-programmer">A guide for the solo programmer</h3>
<p>I have created a planning and organization process for developing software. The process works for me. I need to organize my work ahead of time or I get stuck working on unimportant details.</p>
<p>I have built minimalism into the process. I tend to work alone. Solo programming imposes very real limitations on the scope and completeness of software. One man can only do so much.</p>
<p>My process includes nothing that cannot be found in <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>, <a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html">Paul Graham’s writing</a>, and <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>. These are well-written and well-known works. I thought I understood them when I read them, but I was wrong. It wasn’t until recently, after projects stalled and failed due to feature creep, that I understood the essence of the <em>release early, release often</em> idea. I have attempted to formalize the idea to be more actionable instead of philosophical.</p>
<p>Here is my hard-earned process for writing software. Note that this is not a strict algorithm. Sometimes I will apply filters from Step 2 when I am doing experiments in Step 3.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Choose a purpose.</strong></p>
<p>The software must serve a single purpose. Clearly defining it will illuminate the entire software process.</p></li>
<li><p>For each release:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>List features.</strong></p>
<p>List out all of the features you want in the software. Not all of these will make it into the release, but if it is <em>not</em> on this list, it will <em>not</em> make it into the release.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the following filters and transformations, in any order, repeatedly, until there is nothing further to filter out from the list of features.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Break features into subfeatures.</strong></p>
<p>If a feature can be broken into two features, do it. All features must be atomic. For instance, an easy one would be if I want to send messages by email and through a web API, that’s two features. Rule of thumb: if it can break, it’s a separate feature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eliminate unnecessary features.</strong></p>
<p>Features that are not essential to the purpose are unnecessary. Features that can be put off until the next version are unnecessary. In the above example, maybe email can wait until the next release. If it can wait, it will wait. You are trying to make a B line to release.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fill in “hidden features”.</strong></p>
<p>Remember, if it can break, it’s a feature. Sometimes there are features that need to be listed because of the existence of other features. If you support two different communication channels, you need a way to choose between them. Whatever mechanism presents that choice is a feature, too. List it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplify features.</strong></p>
<p>If a feature can be done more simply or more easily than what you originally intended, replace it. The primary way to release quickly is to simplify the release. Do you really need it to be customizable?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Design and carry out experiments.</strong></p>
<p>Within your minimal set of features, there are often questions as to the best means of implementation. The experiments determine the answers to those questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Order the features in order of dependency.</strong></p>
<p>The first feature is the one that does not depend on any others. Dependency is a complex and sneaky issue. You might say that a function needs a button to activate it. But the button is useless without the function. Which depends on which? Personally, dependency means dependent on another feature for usefulness. If I can activate a function in a very simple way (like immediately when the program starts), then that function does not depend on the button. The button depends on the function for its usefulness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sketch out the <em>first</em> remaining feature on paper.</strong></p>
<p>Sketch out the code. The experiments should have instructed you in how to implement the feature. Rewrite the code repeatedly, eliminating fluff and abstraction until the code is minimal and perfect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type the code in.</strong></p>
<p>Build it and test it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make the code rock solid.</strong></p>
<p>Clean it up. As a solo programmer, you are <em>never</em> going to come back to this code and clean it up. You won’t have time. You will never have the time to hunt for bugs in this code. Make sure it works in every possible case. The code must catch every exception. It must handle the null case. The feature is not done until it is unbreakable. If you are doubting whether it’s worth your time to work this much on one feature, maybe you should eliminate the feature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loop to Step 5 until you run out of features.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release.</strong></p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The essence of this process is to follow the <em>release early, release often</em> philosophy by reducing the amount of development between releases. I mistakenly thought that release often meant “write code really fast” in the past. Now I understand that it means write less but more important code between releases but write it correctly.</p>

<p>Summary: <em>&quot;Prefer data over functions&quot; is a common adage in Clojure circles. It is poorly debated because it is a terse statement in generalities. A valuable perspective is that data is transparent at runtime, while functions are not. This perspective gives a firm ground for discussion and design.</em></p>
<p>There's a design rule of thumb in Clojure that says that we should prefer functions to macros and to prefer data to functions. People talk about <em>why</em>, people react saying that functions <em>are</em> data, etc. It's all true, but it's all missing the point. It doesn't get at the fundamental, structural difference. And I think the discussion breaks down because people speak in generalities and not much is made measurable and concrete. But the pregression from macros to functions to data is, in my opinion, increasing in one important aspect, and that's the <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/reification"><strong>availability at runtime</strong></a>. Discussions should hinge on whether availability at runtime is desirable, which of course needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3 id="macros">Macros</h3>
<p>Macros in Clojure are simply not available at runtime. By definition, they are expanded at compile time. It would be hard to make sense to be passing around macros as runtime values. Try to pass a macro as an argument to a function. You can't.</p>
<p>Further, once a macro has been expanded, it is no longer clear that it's expanded code even came from that macro. <strong>Macros are opaque at runtime.</strong></p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>Functions <em>are</em> first-class values. They can be passed around to functions, stored in maps, etc. They are totally available at runtime to be called.</p>
<p>But, calling them is about all you can do with them (besides building new functions with them, like with composition). You can't even easily inspect the code that's inside them, nor get at the environment they have closed over. And that's kind of the point. The function is a useful unit of computation. <strong>It's not a unit of semantics.</strong></p>
<p>A function, too, is opaque in its way. A function, at runtime, is a black box. What does it do? You can't tell. You can't even tell how the function got there. Was it a <code>fn</code> defined in code? Or was it the result of function composition using <code>comp</code>? <strong>That information is not available at runtime.</strong></p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>In Clojure, by <em>data</em>, people are really talking about the immutable data structures available in Clojure. Just to be concrete, let's narrow the definition of Clojure data down to edn.</p>
<p>Edn data is available at runtime. It's first-class in the way that functions are and macros are not. But it is also transparent. <strong>The structure of the data is completely available at runtime</strong>, unlike the structure of the function. This is why data is preferable.</p>
<p>Because data is available at runtime, you can do many things with it. Does the data describe a computation? Well, write an interpreter. <strong>Interpreters are much easier to write than compilers</strong> (macros) because the interpreter runs at runtime in the dynamic environment of the program. Compilers (and macros) separate out the two phases of compile-time and runtime. You have to keep track of the difference in your code. And Lisp is totally well-suited for writing interpreters. The first Lisp was defined in itself, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>And since it's just edn, it can also be <strong>manipulated using all of the tools available in the language</strong>. Maps can be <code>assoc</code>ed to. Sequences can be iterated. Transfering it over the wire is easy. Storing it to disk in a way that can be read in is easy. Try pretty-printing a function. But pretty-printing a data structure? Easy.</p>
<p>And, finally, the other thing about data is that it can be interpreted in different ways by different interpreters. I'm not trying to say that you might implement two algorithms for doing the same thing. What I'm getting at is that you can compute from it, or analyze it, or algebraically transform it, etc. <strong>It has become a semantic system in its own right.</strong></p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p><em>Why not work with code, which is data in Clojure?</em></p>
<p>You can argue that since code is data, why should I use data structures likes maps and vectors instead of actual code, represented as lists? This is actually a very valid point, and I think this is one of the better arguments. Lisp was defined in terms of an interpreter for data structures which together provide a powerful programming model. <strong>It would be foolish to discard this power and define our own for no reason.</strong></p>
<p>The best reason I can think of is that our data is usually a very restricted form of code, many times not Turing complete. <strong>Turing complete code is proven to be impossible to analyze.</strong> But our restricted data model is powerful in exactly the way we need it (for our specific problem), but not <em>generally</em> powerful (as in Turing complete). So we can design it to be analyzable.</p>
<p>If we can restrict the power to be less-than-Turing-complete, we can analyze it at runtime. <strong>If analyzing it at runtime is desirable, then it is desirable to represent it as data.</strong></p>
<p><em>The semantics of data is vague, while code is well-defined. Why should we use data instead of code?</em></p>
<p>Ok, this is also a good point. Clojure code, in theory, is well defined. At the very least, it is defined as whatever the compiler does. Most of the time, it is well-documented and well-understood. <strong>But your ad-hoc data structure, which represents some computation, has all sorts of assumptions baked in, like what keys are valid when, that are undocumented, have poor error messages, and maybe corner cases.</strong></p>
<p>Wow, such a good point. When you're designing a DSL, this is always a challenge. But, just like restricting your power to below Turing complete can make your analysis way easier, <strong>keeping your semantic model simple and well-defined is the key to making it worthwhile.</strong> If the semantic model is simple, it could be beneficial to have it available at runtime. For instance, you could create a custom editor for it. If it's just functions, that's out.</p>
<p><em>Hasn't this discussion happened many times before? I mean, Ant started off ok, but then it was its own programming language and it sucked.</em></p>
<p>This is very true. People have talked before about the difference between internal and external DSLs, and how external DSLs eventually lose because they need all sorts of conditionals and loops, which the internal DSLs had by default. In my experience, this is true.</p>
<p>My personal guideline is that I only prefer data after I have bound the problem to a well-understood domain. That means that I have to write the program first in code, using functions, before I realize that, yes, this could be described very succinctly and declaratively as data. This took a long time and lots of mistakes to understand. <strong>I essentially will only refactor to a data-driven approach after I already have it written and working.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>I've been coding in Lisp for a long time, so <strong>I've internalized this idea of data-driven programming</strong>. It's the main idea of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558601910">Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</a>, one of the best Lisp books out there, and a big influence on me. What the guideline of &quot;Prefer data over functions&quot; means <em>to me</em> is that when it's beneficial, one should choose data, even if functions are easy to write. Data is more flexible and more available at runtime. It's one of those all-things-being-equal situations. But all things are rarely equal. <strong>Data is often more verbose and error-prone than straight code.</strong></p>
<p>But there is a sweet spot where data is vastly superior. In those cases, it makes your code more readable. It is more amenable to analysis. It can be passed over the wire. <strong>When I find one of those cases, you bet I'll prefer data over functions.</strong></p>
<p>I think that doing data-driven programming is one of the things Clojure excels at, even more than other Lisps, because of its literal data structure syntax. <strong>Data-driven programming is one of the deep experiences that I wish everyone could have.</strong> And it's the primary goal of <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure">LispCast Introduction to Clojure</a>, my 1.5 hour video course filled with visuals, animations, exercises, and screencasts.

<p>Summary: <em>There are many great resources out there for learning Clojure. Some of the resources are paid, but fortunately many of the best resources are absolutely free.</em></p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in learning Clojure?</strong> Would you like to get started without risking your money on a book? Is there something that can help you even know whether you want to learn Clojure?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Well, just at the last minute, this interview was finished. Jason Hemann is the organizer of this year's <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jhemann/scheme-14/">Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop</a> that is happening just before the Conj. Tickets are very affordable and still available.</p>
<p>The schemers are inviting everyone to attend <em>Programming Enthusiasts Unite for Great Justice</em>, an after-hours event at 8:30 on Wednesday, November 19 at the Mezzanine Lounge, Capitol City Brewing Company, 1100 New York Ave. I'm going to be there, so say hi!</p>
<p>On with the interview!</p>
<h3 id="interview">Interview</h3>
<p><strong>LispCast</strong>: Tell me a bit about the Scheme Workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hemann</strong>: The Scheme Workshop (or Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop, to use the full title) is an annual meeting for the community of folk interested in Scheme and functional programming generally. The purpose is to report recent developments in the language, to foster collaboration among the members of the community, and for researchers, implementers, and users to present recent work.</p>
<p>The first workshop was held in 2000, making this the Scheme Workshop's 15th anniversary. In previous years we've hosted it with PLI, ICFP, and SPLASH, among other venues. We're excited this year to again be co-located with Clojure/conj.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What is something that Clojure (as a language or as a community) can learn from Scheme?</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: I think the Schemer's view of the world offers an interesting comparison for Clojurers. To me, Scheme is a tiny extensible core, one basic data structure (the cons pair), tail recursion, and the ability to redefine almost everything in the language. It is amazing how few primitives you can get away with using in practice. To quote from a recent standard document,</p>
<p>&quot;Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language....&quot;</p>
<p>From this vantage point, Clojure feels like an extremely large and complex language (this is not to say it's the correct or only point of view, of course).</p>
<p>Historically, the design of Scheme has had relatively few compromises---some might say because there wasn't much language to begin with. This feels very different than Clojure, which readily compromises in order to interact with Java seamlessly. For example, Scheme implementations must handle tail calls properly. This isn't to say that Clojure makes the wrong decision--Clojure has different design goals, and unoptimized tail calls makes sense when interacting with Java. But by comparison Scheme feels very uncompromised, and it's fun to play around in such a minimal language with relatively few corner cases.</p>
<p>That design fits well with the Scheme workflow for writing small programs. Many Schemes exist as single standalone executables; you simply run it, and the REPL starts instantly. And then you're programming. There aren't any toolchains to build, projects to setup, or package dependencies to fight with. Compared with other languages' toolchains and workflows, there is very little to get in the way of thinking about a problem, and Scheme feels lightweight and nimble by comparison.</p>
<p>There are obviously tradeoffs to this design, and there can be a strain when trying to move to medium to large scale projects. Scheme has no large standard library, or standard build and versioning tools, or canonical directory layout, or anything like that. When creating large- or even medium-sized applications, the support you get in the Clojure world can be very useful. But when trying to quickly experiment with a new idea, Scheme doesn't have the encumberance of these (admittedly sometimes useful) features.</p>
<p>Scheme has been a useful tool for exploring and explaining new ideas, some of which have found their way into Scheme itself. Its relatively small size has made it a proving ground for language features. The Scheme approach has been to lean toward adding fewer, more highly expressive primitives. An example of this is the Scheme operator call/cc, which subsumes what would otherwise be a variety of distinct primitives.</p>
<p>Another idea that Schemers have explored and then added to the language is hygienic macros. While traditional unhygienic and pseudo-hygienic macros do great things for other lisps, Scheme's hygienic macros and the more recent procedural hygienic macro systems designed and developed in Scheme have really pushed the state of the art forward. The macro systems available in Scheme seem more usable than those of other lisps, and lead to more readable and more reliable code as well.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: So, now the opposite: what can Scheme learn from Clojure?</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: Well, one thing I haven't mentioned yet is that Scheme is in the process of growing. The Scheme steering committee hopes both to keep Scheme as this small, lightweight language, but also make it a language able to meet &quot;the practical needs of modern software development&quot;. The groups working on the latest language standard are producing both a spec for a small language and a spec for a large language, which is to be, by some metrics, larger than Common Lisp. The small language report is finished and was announced at last year's Scheme Workshop. This year, we will hear an update from John Cowan, the head of the large language working group. I'm excited to hear what they've been up to.</p>
<p>I mention this all because Clojure is a recent, comparatively large lisp designed with the practical considerations of real software development in mind. Clojure provides an example of one way to build a large language and ecosystem, and from which we can learn. The first thing that comes to mind is persistent data structures. Clojure comes out-of-the-box with a suite of persistent data structures that'd make programmers in a lot of other languages envious. The R7 large group has an immutable data structures proposal on the table, and I think that would be a nice addition. Clojure has a number of libraries that could be good additions to the large language.</p>
<p>Too, for a (comparatively) young language you all have---and have had---a broad, vibrant, and growing community. The conj itself is a <em>big</em> event. The recipe for that kind of enthusiasm and growth is something I hope the Scheme community can bring back with us.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: What are some resources for Clojurists who want to learn about Scheme to prep for the workshop?</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: Clojurists are already about as well prepared as anybody to learn about Scheme. That's the wonderful thing about being close linguistic cousins. A classic introductory text that uses Scheme to talk about some really neat concepts is Abelson &amp; Sussman's &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot;. Another good resource is &quot;The Little Schemer&quot; by Friedman &amp; Felleisen. It's cute, and as much puzzle book as it is textbook (full disclosure, my advisor is one of the authors). As far as online references, <a href="http://schemers.org">schemers.org</a>, <a href="http://readscheme.org">readscheme.org</a>, and <a href="http://schemewiki.org">schemewiki.org</a> have enough information to keep one busy for quite a while. Also, we've just put up on the <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jhemann/scheme-14">Scheme '14 website</a> the papers that will be presented. Those still hungry for more might be interested in the proceedings of previous years' Scheme Workshops, available at <a href="http://schemeworkshop.org">schemeworkshop.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LC</strong>: Thanks for the great interview!</p>

              Elm FRP in Clojure core.async
            </a>
          </h2>

          <div class="timestamp">
            November 14, 2014
          </div>

          
<p>Summary: <em>Elm is an exciting FRP language. I implemented the FRP part in Clojure using core.async.</em></p>
<p>I like to read research papers. I have ever since I was in high school. <strong>I've always wanted it to be pretty easy to just translate the pseudocode for an algorithm for a paper and then have it working without any trouble.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, this rarely happens. Either the pseudo-code leaves out important details, or it's expressed in terms that are not available abstractions in any language I know. So then <strong>I am left to puzzle it all out</strong>, and who has the time?</p>
<p>A few months ago I read the <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf">fantastic thesis</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/czaplic">Evan Czaplicki</a><sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> where he introduces <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. It includes a novel way to express <strong>asynchronous Functional Reactive Programming</strong> (which he calls <em>Concurrent FRP</em>) and a way to express GUI layouts functionally.</p>
<p><strong>I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf">thesis</a>.</strong> It is very clear and readable, and points you to valuable resources.</p>
<p>The reason I was reading it was because I think <strong>FRP has a bright future</strong>. It's definitely got potential for simplifying the way we write interactive applications. I wanted to learn how it works so that I could build bigger castles in the sky.</p>
<p>Elm FRP is pretty cool. It is, first of all, very few parts. <strong>You build bigger abstractions from those small parts.</strong> It is built so that events trickle through the graph in order. In other words, they're synchronized.</p>
<p>But the other interesting thing is that sometimes you don't want things to be synchronized. What if one of the calculations takes a long time? You don't want the GUI to stop responding to mouse events while that slow thing is happening. Elm lets you segment the graph into different <strong>subgraphs that can propagate concurrently</strong>.</p>
<p>Seriously, just read the thesis.</p>
<p>While I was reading it, I got to <strong>this page where he lays out all of the FRP functions in Concurrent ML</strong>. It's not uncommon for entire Computer Science theses to be written, passed, and published without a line of runnable code. But here it was, in <em>real code</em> (no pseudocode). I don't know ML, but I do know Haskell, which is related. And I started puzzling through it, trying to understand it.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://www.lispcast.com/img/elm-frp.png" alt="Elm FRP in Concurrent ML" /><p class="caption">Elm FRP in Concurrent ML</p>
</div>
<p>By flipping between the text and the code, I got it. And then I realized: <strong>everything I needed to write this was in Clojure with core.async</strong>. So I got to work.</p>
<p>It took a while of playing with different representations, but I got something I can use and that is pretty much a direct translation of the Concurrent ML code from the thesis. I toyed with some deeper factorizations, but I think they only muddy what's going on. And <strong>it runs in both Clojure and ClojureScript</strong>. It's <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/elm-frp">available on Github</a>.</p>
<p>And, of course, I needed to test my creation, so <strong>I ported the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/edit/examples/Intermediate/Mario.elm">Mario example from the Elm website</a></strong>. You have to click on it to start it. Use the arrow keys to walk left/right and up to jump. It captures your keystrokes. Click outside of the box to get your scrolling keys back.</p>
<div id="mario" style="width: 100%; height: 200px" tabindex="100"></div>

<script src="http://www.lispcast.com/files/mario.js"></script>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/elm-frp/blob/master/src/cljs/elm/examples/mario.cljs">The code for Mario.</a></p>
<p>Now, <strong>I didn't write all of the cool GUI stuff</strong> from the second part of the thesis. I was learning Om so I decided to use that. That's why that part is so long. Writing Om components is basically as long as writing HTML + CSS.</p>
<p>And Elm is a language built around these FRP abstractions, so a lot of the signals are built in. I had to write <strong>event handlers to capture the mouse clicks and keyboard events</strong>. But right in the <a href="https://github.com/ericnormand/elm-frp/blob/e8a5d222e5f7cb2efd90393a6ff1a55e797a8dd2/src/cljs/elm/examples/mario.cljs#L74">middle of mario.cljs</a>, you'll see a very straightforward translation of the Mario example from Elm.</p>
<p>There are a few differences between the Elm version and the Clojure version. Clojure is untyped, so I was able to <strong>eliminate a channel</strong> used only to carry an input node id. That instead is passed along with the message on a single channel.</p>
<p>Also, I added a node type called &quot;pulse&quot; which I use for emitting time deltas for calculating physics. I'm not sure if Elm internally does something similar for its timers but it seems like the correct solution. The trick is you want to <strong>emit a zero time delta</strong> while other events are firing, and an actual time delta when the timer ticks.</p>
<p>Finally, instead of the graph being global as in the thesis, it's all tied to an &quot;event stream&quot;, which is where you send the events which get channeled to the correct input signal. You can have <strong>multiple event streams and hence multiple graphs</strong>.</p>
<p>The implementation is very straightforward. You have to know the basics of Clojure core.async, plus <a href="http://rupsshankar.tumblr.com/post/66648884392/demystifying-core-asyncs-tap-and-mult"><code>mult</code> and <code>tap</code></a>. core.async brings Clojure a new set of abstractions that let us <strong>tap into more research and learn from more languages</strong>. And that makes me happy :)</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn core.async, I have to recommend my own video course <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/core-async">LispCast Clojure core.async</a>. It teaches the <strong>most important concepts from core.async</strong> using story, animation, and exercises. It is no exaggeration to say that it was the most anticipated Clojure video when it came out. Go check out a <a href="http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/core-async#preview">preview</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-true-history">A true history</h3>
<p>Summary: <em>Conveyor belts are strikingly similar to Clojure core.async channels. While it could be a coincidence, there is speculation that conveyor belts were influenced by a deep understanding of core.async.</em></p>
<p><strong>Who invented the conveyor belt?</strong> No one knows for sure. Many historians believe that it was Henry Ford, seeking to mechanize the transportation of car parts from one part of the factory to another. This conservative view is plausible. Henry Ford designed much of the assembly line in his factories.</p>
<p>Despite the simplicity of this explanation, a small minority of researchers believe that there was a man behind Henry Ford who was the true inventor of the conveyor belt. Not much is known about him, but <strong>historians have pieced together a different story</strong>. This article is about that story.</p>

<p>This is a classic picture of Henry Ford standing in front of his creation. Recent advances in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk">digital imaging enhancement</a> have allowed us to learn a little more about the people that influenced Ford who, until recently, have <strong>lived within his shadow</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>While the identity of this man is not known, historians have reassembled a story from bits and pieces of Henry Ford's journals and quotes. It is believed (by those few, brave historians) that <strong>this man is the true inventor of the conveyor belt</strong>. He looks eerily similar to the famed inventor of Clojure, Rich Hickey. However, the chronologies do not match up, so this hypothesis is easily ruled out.</p>
<h3 id="conveyor-belt-similarities-to-core.async-channels">Conveyor belt similarities to core.async channels</h3>
<p>It is well understood that the conveyor belt is a poor, physical compromise on the much more reasonable abstraction of the Clojure core.async channel. As lossy as the copy is, it is still quite useful. <strong>core.async channels and conveyor belts have many properties in common.</strong></p>
<h4 id="things-can-be-put-onto-and-taken-off-of-a-conveyor-belt">Things can be put onto and taken off of a conveyor belt</h4>
<p>The similarity here is uncanny. It is almost as if the inventor of the conveyor belt <strong>had some knowledge of the core.async operations</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="the-conveyor-belt-serves-as-a-buffer">The conveyor belt serves as a buffer</h4>
<p>Again, it is striking that the conveyor belt can serve nearly the same purpose as a core.async channel. On long conveyor belts, the people taking things off and putting things on <strong>might not even know each other</strong>. And for things that take an unknown amount of time, you can just point to the conveyor belt and say &quot;Wait here for the thing you need.&quot; <strong>They don't have to know when or from where it is coming.</strong></p>
<h4 id="things-can-be-taken-off-in-the-same-order-they-are-put-on">Things can be taken off in the same order they are put on</h4>
<p>This is something that perhaps the conveyor belt has lost. While <strong>core.async channels always maintain their own semantics</strong> for choosing which thing is taken next, conveyor belts are basically dumb and expose all of their contents. However, it is clear that you could enforce the common &quot;first-in-first-out&quot; queue behavior by always taking the last item from a conveyor belt.</p>
<h4 id="when-the-conveyor-belt-is-full-the-putter-has-to-wait">When the conveyor belt is full, the &quot;putter&quot; has to wait</h4>
<p>What happens when the conveyor belt fills up? Well, you <strong>wait for some room</strong>. Everyone has had this experience where you're at the supermarket and the cashier is taking too long to ring up your food so the conveyor belt fills up. You just have to wait with a dumb look while they look up the code for celery.</p>
<h4 id="when-the-conveyor-belt-is-empty-the-taker-waits">When the conveyor belt is empty, the &quot;taker&quot; waits</h4>
<p>Conversely to the full belt situation, when the belt is empty the taker must wait. This is what happens when the cashier is faster than the shopper at the supermarket. <strong>There's nothing to do but wait</strong> for some groceries to reach the end of the belt.</p>
<h3 id="differences-between-conveyor-belts-and-core.async-channels">Differences between conveyor belts and core.async channels</h3>
<p>Though the evidence that core.async influenced the development of the conveyor belt is overwhelming, there are some differences due to the <strong>physical limitations of time and space</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="non-instantaneous-transfer">Non-instantaneous transfer</h4>
<p>Though not truly instantaneous, core.async channels do operate at the speed of light. When a value is put onto a channel, <strong>it is immediately available to be taken</strong>. Contrast this with conveyor belts, which slowly move objects along a physical belt.</p>
<h4 id="limited-in-length">Limited in length</h4>
<p>Conveyor belts have finite length. But core.async channels can be passed around just like any other object. They, in fact, are not limited by space at all. Also, the length of a conveyor belt is equivalent to its size as a buffer. But core.async channels have <strong>properly decomplected buffer size from &quot;distance&quot; of travel</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="no-droppingsliding-semantics">No dropping/sliding semantics</h4>
<p>It is quite curious that this important feature of core.async channels has not been copied to conveyor belts. <strong>core.async channels can be set up to drop either the newest value added or the oldest value added.</strong> Conveyor belts that do that are considered defective. The best explanation is that physical goods are so expensive compared to computing ephemeral values that it is uneconomical to trow away any items after they are made.</p>
<p>The jury is still out as to whether core.async influenced the development of conveyor belts. Was Tony Hoare, who invented Communicating Sequential Processes (on which core.async is based) given the secret to CSP by this same man? This hypothesis becomes more convincing when we see the immense similarities between conveyor belts and core.async channels.</p>
