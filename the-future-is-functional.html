<p>Summary: <em>Man</em></p>
<p>By the end of this article, I want you to know two things. The first thing is what functional programming is. The second thing, and this might be more important, is how important it is that you adopt functional programming for the major functions at your business.</p>
<p>You see, computing is one of the most marvelous things that has happened to humans since the invention of the printing press. Computing has changed the world incredibly fast. Starting in the 1940s during World War II, computers have been getting faster and cheaper and more plentiful. If you wrote a program and it was not fast enough, all you had to do was wait 18 months and buy a new computer. Then the same program was twice as fast. And that happened for 60 years.</p>
<p>Do you have kids? I have a daughter. Every day I watch her grow up. Sometimes it's hard to see. But I know it's happening. She'll have a birthday and get all sorts of clothes. Now, invariably, someone will give her something that's just too big for her to wear. That's ok. We just put it in the back of the drawer, then one day, without calling the tailor, it fits. Like magic. You see, computers were like kids. It was a new technology, growing up, faster than you could keep up with. You'd put some software on the shelf and the next time you upgraded your computer, it would be fast enough. Of course that just meant that the software companies would write even slower software. But that's no problem! Just wait 18 months.</p>
<p>And what would happen within three days of putting those new, perfect-fitting clothes on? Sometimes within the first day? Stains. Dirt stains. Grass stains. Food stains.</p>
<p>And it's not just physical growth. Her mind is getting better. She can think better. She can remember more things. She has bigger and better ideas. That physical and mental growth are going at this really fast pace until she grows up. Then things slow down. At around 20 years old, there's no more growth. If you're short at 20, well, you're probably not going to be tall. You of course keep getting smarter, but it's just not as fast. You start realizing that if you want to accomplish more than you can do by yourself, you're going to have to work together with other people.</p>
<p>For fifty years we've been able to program a single machine like we owned the place. That's how my daughter operates, too. But just wait until she moves out and gets roommates. Computers nowadays have roommates. When you buy a new computer or even a new phone, it's actually not just one computer, but several processors. Yes, your computer is cohabitating. Your quadcore is actually four people under one roof. They are each fully capable, but they have to share the common resources. They share the kitchen, the living room, and, most important, the bathroom. Yep, there's only one.</p>
<p>Most of our software is kind of like I was when I first moved out. Sure, I was healthy and energetic, but I was</p>
<p>Computers are not getting faster quite as fast as they used to. They're still improving, but the graph is anything but hopeful. Look at the black line on this graph. That's the <em>speed</em> of the computer, how many operations per second it can do. Now look at the blue line. That's how many transistors are on the chip. Why is the number of transistors going up so fast but it's not getting any faster?</p>
